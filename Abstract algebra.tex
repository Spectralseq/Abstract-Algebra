\subsection{Jacobson schemes}
A scheme $X$ is called \textbf{Jacobson} if its underlying space $X$ is Jacobson, in other words, the set $X_0$ of its closed points is dense in $X$. We say a ring $A$ is Jacobson if the scheme $\Spec(A)$ is Jacobson. Since any closed subset of $X=\Spec(A)$ is of the form $Z=V(\a)$, where $\a$ is a radical ideal of $A$, and the set $X_0$ of closed points of $X$ is the set of maximal ideals of $A$, we see $Z\cap X_0$ is dense in $Z$ if and only if $\a$ is the intersection of maximal ideals containing it. As $\a$ is already the intersection of prime ideals containing it, we see $A$ is a Jacobson ring if and only if each prime ideal of $A$ is the intersection of maximal ideals, which means $A$ is Jacobson in the usual sense.
\begin{proposition}\label{scheme Jacobson iff affine open}
Let $X$ be a scheme and $(U_\alpha)$ be an affine open covering of $X$. Then for $X$ to be Jacobson, it is necessary and sufficient that the ring $\Gamma(U_\alpha,\mathscr{O}_X)$ of $U_\alpha$ is Jacobson for all $\alpha$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
This is a concequence of Proposition~\ref{}.
\end{proof}
\begin{example}[\textbf{Example of Jacobson schemes}]
\mbox{}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] A discrete scheme is Jacobson; an Artianian ring is therefore Jacobson.
\item[(b)] Any PID with infinitely many prime ideals is Jacobson (Proposition~\ref{Jacobson PID iff}).
\item[(c)] A Noetherian local ring $A$ is Jacobson if and only if the maximal ideal is the unique prime ideal, which means $A$ is Artianian.
\item[(d)] Any subscheme of a Jacobson scheme is again Jacobson, by Proposition~\ref{}.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}
\begin{proposition}\label{ring integral fraction field finite type iff}
Let $B$ be an integral domain. The following conditions are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(\rmnum{1})] There exists $f\neq 0$ in $B$ such that $B_f$ is a field.
\item[(\rmnum{2})] The fraction field of $B$ is a $B$-algebra of finite type.
\item[(\rmnum{3})] There exists a field $K$ containing $B$ that is a $B$-algebra of finite type.
\item[(\rmnum{4})] The generic point of $\Spec(B)$ is isolated in $\Spec(B)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
It is clear that (\rmnum{4}) is equivalent to (\rmnum{1}), since (\rmnum{4}) just means there exists $f\neq 0$ in $B$ such that $D(f)$ reduces to the generic point of $\Spec(B)$. It is also trivial that (\rmnum{1})$\Rightarrow$(\rmnum{2})$\Rightarrow$(\rmnum{3}). Finally, (\rmnum{3}) implies (\rmnum{1}), in view of Corollary~\ref{integral domain subfield of fraction finite algebra}.
\end{proof}
\begin{proposition}\label{scheme affine Jacobson iff nonclosed point}
Let $A$ be a ring. The following conditions are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(\rmnum{1})] $A$ is a Jacobson ring.
\item[(\rmnum{2})] For any non maximal prime ideal $\p$ of $A$ and any $f\neq 0$ in $B=A/\p$, $B_f$ is not a field.
\item[(\rmnum{3})] Any finite type $A$-algebra $K$ that is a field is a finite $A$-algebra.
\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The equivalence of (\rmnum{1}) and (\rmnum{3}) is given in Theorem~\ref{Jacobson ring iff finite algebra field is finite}.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}\label{ring finite type over Jacobson is Jacobson}
Any finite type algebra $B$ over a Jacobson ring $A$ is Jacobson, and the inverse image in $A$ of any maximal ideal of $B$ is a maximal ideal of $A$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{corollary}\label{scheme finite type over Jacobson is Jacobson}
If $Y$ is a Jacobson scheme and $f:X\to Y$ is a morphism locally of finite type, then $X$ is a Jacobson scheme and the image under $f$ of any closed point of $Y$ is closed in $X$. 
\end{corollary}
\begin{example}
A scheme $X$ that is locally of finite type over $\Z$ is Jacobson. Moreover, we shall see that a point $x\in X$ to be closed in $X$, it is necessary and sufficient that $\kappa(x)$ is finite.
\end{example}
