\section{Simplicial sets}\label{simplicial set section}
For each integer $n\geq 0$, we define the \textbf{$n$-simplex}
\[|\Delta^n|=\{(t_0,\dots,t_n)\in[0,1]^{n+1}:t_0+\cdots+t_n=1\}.\]
as a topological simplex of dimension $n$. For any topological space $X$, a continuous map $\sigma:|\Delta^n|\to X$ is called a \textbf{singular $\bm{n}$-simplex} in $X$. Every singular $n$-simplex $\sigma$ determines a finite collection of singular $(n-1)$-simplices $\{d_i\sigma\}_{0\leq i\leq n}$, called the faces of $\sigma$, which are given explicitly by the formula
\[(d_i\sigma)(t_0,\dots,t_{n-1})=\sigma(t_0,t_1,\dots,t_{i-1},0,t_i,\dots,t_{n-1}).\]
Let $\Sing_n(X)=\Hom_{\mathsf{Top}}(|\Delta^n|,X)$ denote the set of singular $n$-simplices of $X$. Many important algebraic invariants of $X$ can be directly extracted from the sets $\{\Sing_n(X)\}_{n\geq 0}$ and the face maps $\{d_i:\Sing_n(X)\to\Sing_{n-1}(X)\}_{0\leq i\leq n}$.
\begin{example}[\textbf{Singular Homology}]\label{simplicial set singular homology from Sing}
For any topological space $X$, the singular homology groups $H_*(X,\Z)$ are defined as the homology groups of a chain complex
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\cdots\ar[r,"\partial"]&\Z[\Sing_2(X)]\ar[r,"\partial"]&\Z[\Sing_1(X)]\ar[r,"\partial"]&\Z[\Sing_0(X)]
\end{tikzcd}\]
where $\Z[\Sing_n(X)]$ is the free abelian group over $\Sing_n(X)$ and the boundary map $\partial$ is defined by
\[\partial(\sigma)=\sum_{i=0}^{n}(-1)^id_i\sigma.\]
\end{example}
For some other algebraic invariants, it is convenient to keep track of a bit more structure. A singular $n$-simplex $\sigma:|\Delta^n|\to X$ also determines a collection of singular $(n+1)$-simplices $\{s_i\sigma\}_{0\leq i\leq n}$, given by the formula
\[(s_i\sigma)(t_0,\dots,t_{n+1})=\sigma(t_0,t_1,\dots,t_{i-1},t_i+t_{i+1},t_{i+2},\dots,t_{n+1}).\]
The resulting constructions $s_i:\Sing_n(X)\to\Sing_{n+1}(X)$ are called \textbf{degeneracy maps}, because singular $(n+1)$-simplices of the form $s_i\sigma$ factor through the linear projection $|\Delta^{n+1}|\to|\Delta^n|$. For example, the map $s_0:\Sing_0(X)\to\Sing_1(X)$ carries each point $x\in X\cong\Sing_0(X)$ to the constant map $\uline{x}:\Delta^1\to X$ taking the value $x$. In general, one can view the map $s_i$ as obtained by "squashing" the simplex $|\Delta^{n+1}|$ along the direction of one of its face to obtain a $|\Delta^n|$.
\begin{example}[\textbf{Fundamental Group}]\label{simplicial set pi_1 from Sing}
Let $X$ be a topological space equipped with a base point $x\in X\cong\Sing_0(X)$. Then continuous paths $p:[0,1]\to X$ satisfying $p(0)=p(1)=x$ can be identified with elements of the set $\{\sigma\in\Sing_1(X):d_0\sigma=d_1\sigma=x\}$. The fundamental group $\pi_1(X,x)$ can then be described as the quotient
\[\{\sigma\in\Sing_1(X):d_0(\sigma)=d_1(\sigma)=x\}/\sim\]
where $\sim$ is the equivalence relation on $\Sing_1(X)$ described by $\sigma\sim\sigma'$ if and only if there exists $\tau\in\Sing_2(X)$ such that $d_0(\tau)=s_0(x)$, $d_1(\tau)=\sigma$ and $d_2(\tau)=\sigma'$. The datum of a $2$-simplex $\tau$ satisfying these conditions is equivalent to the datum of a continuous map $|\Delta^2|\to X$ with boundary behavior as indicated in the following diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
&x\ar[rd,"\uline{x}"]&\\
x\ar[ru,"\sigma'"]\ar[rr,"\sigma"]&&x
\end{tikzcd}\]
It is easy to see that such a map can be identified with a homotopy between the paths determined by $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$.
\end{example}
Motivated by the preceding examples, we can ask the following question: given a topological space $X$, what can we say about the collection of sets $\{\Sing_n(X)\}_{n\geq 0}$, together with the face and degeneracy maps
\[d_i:\Sing_n(X)\to\Sing_{n-1}(X),\quad s_i:\Sing_n(X)\to\Sing_{n+1}(X).\]
Eilenberg and Zilber supplied an answer to this by introducing what they called \textit{complete semi-simplicial complexes}, which are now more commonly known as \textit{simplicial sets}. Roughly speaking, a simplicial set $S_\bullet$ is a collection of sets $\{S_n\}_{n\geq 0}$ indexed by the nonnegative integers, equipped with face and degeneracy operators $\{d_i:S_n\to S_{n-1},s_i:S_n\to S_{n+1}\}_{0\leq i\leq n}$ satisfying a short list of identities. These identities can be summarized conveniently by saying that a simplicial set is a presheaf on the simplex category $\Delta$, which we will define later. Simplicial sets are connected to algebraic topology by two closely related constructions
\begin{itemize}
\item For every topological space $X$, the face and degeneracy operators defined above endow the collection $\{\Sing_n(X)\}_{n\geq 0}$ with the structure of a simplicial set. We denote this simplicial set by $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ and refer to it as the \textbf{singular simplicial set of $X$}. These simplicial sets tend to be quite large: in any nontrivial example, the sets $\Sing_n(X)$ will be uncountable for every nonnegative integer $n$.
\item Any simplicial set $S_\bullet$ can be regarded as a "blueprint" for constructing a topological space $|S_\bullet|$ called the \textbf{geometric realization} of $S_\bullet$, which can be obtained as a quotient of the disjoint union $\coprod_{n\geq 0}S_n\times|\Delta^n|$ by an equivalence relation determined by the face and degeneracy operators on $S_\bullet$. Many topological spaces of interest (for example, any space which admits a finite triangulation) can be realized as a geometric realization of a simplicial set $S_\bullet$ having only finitely many nondegenerate simplices.
\end{itemize}
These constructions determine adjoint functors
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\mathbf{Set}_{\Delta}\ar[r,shift left=1mm,"|\ |"]&\mathbf{Top}\ar[l,shift left=1mm,"\Sing_\bullet"]
\end{tikzcd}\]
relating the category $\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$ of simplicial sets to the category $\mathbf{Top}$ of topological spaces. For any (pointed) topological space $X$, \cref{simplicial set singular homology from Sing} and \cref{simplicial set pi_1 from Sing} the singular homology and fundamental group of $X$ can be recovered from the simplicial set $\Sing_\bullet(X)$. In fact, one can say more: under mild assumptions, the entire homotopy type of $X$ can be recovered from $\Sing_\bullet(X)$. More precisely, there is always a canonical map $|\Sing_\bullet(X)|\to X$ (given by the counit of the adjunction described above), and Giever proved that it is always a weak homotopy equivalence (hence a homotopy equivalence when $X$ has the homotopy type of a CW complex). Consequently, for the purpose of studying homotopy theory, nothing is lost by replacing $X$ by $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ and working in the setting of simplicial sets, rather than topological spaces. In fact, it is possible to develop the theory of algebraic topology in entirely combinatorial terms, using simplicial sets as surrogates for topological spaces. However, not every simplicial set $S_\bullet$ behaves like the singular complex of a space, and it is therefore necessary to single out a class of "good" simplicial sets to work with. Later we will introduce a special class of simplicial sets, called \textit{Kan complexes}. By a theorem of Milnor, the homotopy theory of Kan complexes is equivalent to the classical homotopy theory of CW complexes.
\subsection{Simplicial and cosimplicial objects}
For every nonnegative integer $n$, we let $[n]$ denote the linearly ordered $\{0,1,\dots,n\}$. We define a category $\Delta$ (called the \textbf{simplex category}) over the ordered sets $[n]$ for $n\geq 0$: a morphism from $[m]$ to $[n]$ in the category $\Delta$ is a \textit{nondecreasing} function $\alpha:[m]\to[n]$. We note that the category $\Delta$ is equivalent to the category of all nonempty finite linearly ordered sets, with morphisms given by nondecreasing maps. In fact, we can say something even better: for every nonempty finite linearly ordered set $I$, there is a unique order-preserving bijection $I\cong[n]$, for some $n\geq 0$.\par
Now let $\mathcal{C}$ be an arbitray category. A \textbf{simplicial object} (resp. \textbf{cosimplicial object}) of $\mathcal{C}$ is defined to be a contravariant functor $\Delta^{\op}\to\mathcal{C}$ (resp. convariant functor $\Delta\to\mathcal{C}$). We often use the notation $C_\bullet$ to denote a simplicial object of $\mathcal{C}$. In this case, we use $C_n$ (resp. $C^n$) to denote the value of $C_\bullet$ (resp. $C^\bullet$) on $[n]\in\Delta^{\op}$.\par
As a variant of the category $\Delta$, we define $\Delta_{\inj}$ to be the category whose objects are sets of the form $[n]$ (where $n$ is a nonnegative integer) and whose morphisms are strictly increasing functions $\alpha:[m]\to[n]$. If $\mathcal{C}$ is a category, a contravariant functor $\Delta_{\inj}^{\op}\to\mathcal{C}$ (resp. covariant functor) as a \textbf{semi-simplicial object} (\textbf{semi-cosimplicial object}) of $\mathcal{C}$. We use the notation $C_\bullet$ to indicate a semi-simplicial object of $\mathcal{C}$, whose value on an object $[n]\in\Delta^{\op}_{\inj}$ we denote by $C_n$.
\begin{remark}
The category $\Delta_{\inj}$ can be regarded as a (non-full) subcategory of the category $\Delta$. Consequently, any simplicial object $C_\bullet$ of a category $\mathcal{C}$ determines a semisimplicial object of $\mathcal{C}$, given by the composition
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\Delta_{\inj}^{\op}\ar[r,hook]&\Delta^{\op}\ar[r,"C_\bullet"]&\mathcal{C}
\end{tikzcd}
\]
We will often abuse notation by identifying a simplicial object $C_\bullet$ of $\mathcal{C}$ with the underlying semisimplicial object of $\mathcal{C}$.
\end{remark}
To a first degree of approximation, a simplicial object $C_\bullet$ of a category $\mathcal{C}$ can be identified with the collection of objects $\{C_n\}_{n\geq 0}$. However, these objects are equipped with additional structure, arising from the morphisms in the simplex category $\Delta$. We now spell this out more concretely.\par
Let $n$ be a positive integer. For $0\leq i\leq n$, we let $\delta^i:[n-1]\to[n]$ be the unique strictly increasing function whose image does not contain the element $i$, given concretely by the formula
\[\delta^i(j)=\begin{cases}
j&\text{if $j<i$},\\
j+1&\text{if $j\geq i$}.
\end{cases}\]
If $C_\bullet$ is a (semi-)simplicial object of $\mathcal{C}$, then we can evaluate $C_\bullet$ on the morphism $\delta^i$ to obtain a morphism $d_i:C_n\to C_{n-1}$, called the $i$-th \textbf{face map} of $C_\bullet$. Dually, if $C^\bullet$ is a cosimplicial object of $\mathcal{C}$, then the evaluation of $C^\bullet$ on the morphism $d^i:C^{n-1}\to C^n$ determines a map $d^i:C^{n-1}\to C^n$, called the $i$-th \textbf{coface map}.\par
Smilarly, for $0\leq i\leq n$, let $\sigma^i:[n+1]\to[n]$ denote the function given by the formula
\[\sigma^i(j)=\begin{cases}
j&\text{if $j\leq i$},\\
j-1&\text{if $j>i$}.
\end{cases}\]
If $C_\bullet$ is a simplicial object of a category $\mathcal{C}$, then we can evaluate $C_\bullet$ on the morphism $\sigma_i$ to obtain a morphism $s_i:C_n\to C_{n+1}$, called the $i$-th \textbf{degeneracy map}. Dually, if $C^\bullet$ is a cosimplicial object of $\mathcal{C}$, then the evaluation on $C^\bullet$ on the morphism $\sigma_i$ determines a map $s^i:C^{n+1}\to C^n$, which is called the $i$-th \textbf{codegeneracy map}.
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set face degeneracy map char}
Let $C_\bullet$ be a simplicial object of a category $\mathcal{C}$. Then the face maps and degeneracy maps satisfy the following simplicial identities:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(S1)] For $0\leq i<j\leq n$, we have $d_i\circ d_j=d_{j-1}\circ d_i$.
\item[(S2)] For $0\leq i\leq j\leq n$, we have $s_i\circ s_j=s_{j+1}\circ s_i$.
\item[(S3)] For $0\leq i,j\leq n$, we have
\[d_i\circ s_j=\begin{cases}
s_{j-1}\circ d_i&\text{if $i<j$},\\
1_{C_n}&\text{if $i=j$ or $i=j+1$},\\
s_j\circ d_{i-1}&\text{if $i>j+1$}.
\end{cases}\] 
\end{itemize}
Conversely, any collection of objects $\{C_n\}_{n\geq 0}$ and morphisms $\{d_i:C_n\to C_{n-1},s_i:C_n\to C_{n+1}\}_{0\leq i\leq n}$ satisfying these conditions determine a unique simplicial object of $\mathcal{C}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The above conditions in fact hold for the maps $\delta^i$ and $\sigma^i$, so the first assertion follows from the functoriality. Conversely, let $\{d_i:C_n\to C_{n-1},s_i:C_n\to C_{n+1}\}_{0\leq i\leq n}$ be a family of morphisms satisfying the simplicial identities. In order to define a contravariant functor $C_\bullet:\Delta\to\mathcal{C}$ such that $C_\bullet([n])=C_n$, we show that any nondecreasing map $\alpha:[m]\to[n]$ can be written as a composition $\alpha=\delta\circ\sigma$, where
\[\delta=\delta^{j_1}\circ\cdots\circ\delta^{j_s},\quad 0\leq j_s\leq\cdots\leq j_1\leq n\]
and
\[\sigma=\sigma^{i_1}\circ\cdots\circ\sigma^{j_t},\quad 0\leq i_1<\cdots<i_t<m.\]
For this, let $j_s<\cdots<j_1$ be the elements of $[n]$ not in the image of $\alpha$ and $i_1<\dots<i_t$ be the elements of $[m]$ such that $\alpha(i)=\alpha(i+1)$. Then if $p=m-t=n-s$, the map $\alpha$ factors into
\[\begin{tikzcd}
{[m]}\ar[r,two heads,"\sigma"]&{[p]}\ar[r,hook,"\delta"]&{[n]}
\end{tikzcd}\]
It then suffices to decompose the maps $\delta$ and $\sigma$, which is straightforward.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}\label{semi-simplicial set face map char}
Let $C_\bullet$ be a semi-simplicial object of a category $\mathcal{C}$. Then the face maps satisfy the condition (S1). Conversely, any collection of objects $\{C_n\}_{n\geq 0}$ and morphisms $\{d_i:C_n\to C_{n-1}\}_{0\leq i\leq n}$ satisfying (S1) determine a unique semisimplicial object of $\mathcal{C}$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
This follows from the fact that any increasing map $\alpha:[m]\to[n]$ can be written as a composition of the $d_i$.
\end{proof}
Let $\mathbf{Set}$ denote the category of sets. A \textbf{simplicial set} is then by definition a simplicial object of $\mathbf{Set}$: that is, a contravariant functor $\Delta^{\op}\to\mathbf{Set}$. Similarly, a \textbf{semi-simplicial set} is a convariant functor $\Delta\to\mathbf{Set}$. If $S_\bullet$ is a (semi-)simplicial set, then the elements of $S_n$ are called the \textbf{$\bm{n}$-simplices} of $S_\bullet$. The elements of $S_0$ and $S_1$ are also called the \textbf{vertices} and \textbf{edges} of $S_\bullet$ of $S_\bullet$, respectively. The category of contravariant functors from $\Delta$ to $\mathbf{Set}$ is denoted by $\mathbf{Set}_\Delta=\Fun(\Delta^{\op},\mathbf{Set})$ and called the \textbf{category of simplicial sets}.
\begin{remark}
Since the category of sets has all (small) limits and colimits, the category of (semi-)simplicial sets also has all (small) limits and colimits. Moreover, these limits and colimits are computed levelwise: for any functor
\[S_\bullet:\mathcal{C}\to\mathbf{Set}_{\Delta},\quad \mathcal{C}\ni C\mapsto S_\bullet(C)\]
and any nonnegative integer $n$, we have canonical bijections
\[(\rlim_{C\in\mathcal{C}}S(C))_n=\rlim_{C\in\mathcal{C}}S_n(C),\quad (\llim_{C\in\mathcal{C}}S(C))_n=\llim_{C\in\mathcal{C}}S_n(C).\]
\end{remark}
\begin{example}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set. Suppose that, for every integer $n\geq 0$, we are given a subset $T_n\sub S_n$, and that the face and degeneracy maps $d_i:S_n\to S_{n-1}$, $s_i:S_n\to S_{n+1}$ send $T_n$ into $T_{n-1}$ and $T_{n+1}$, respectively. Then by \cref{simplicial set face degeneracy map char}, the collection $\{T_n\}_{n\geq 0}$ inherits the structure of a simplicial set $T_\bullet$. In this case, we say that $T_\bullet$ is a simplicial subset of $S_\bullet$ and write $T_\bullet\sub S_\bullet$.
\end{example}
We now consider some elementary examples of simplicial sets. First, for any integer $n\geq 0$, the object $[n]$ itself determines a simplicial set $\Delta^n=h^{[n]}$: that is, the simplicial set which send $[m]\in\Delta^{\op}$ to $\Hom_\Delta([m],[n])$. The simplicial set $\Delta^n$ is called the \textbf{standard $\bm{n}$-simplex}, and by convention, we set $\Delta^{-1}=\emp$ for $n=-1$.\par
Since any set can be mapped onto $[0]$ in a unique way, it is clear that the standard $0$-simplex $\Delta^0$ is a final object of the category of simplicial sets; note that $\Delta^0$ carries each $[n]$ to a set having a single element.\par
For each $n\geq 0$, the standard $n$-simplex $\Delta^n$ is characterized by the following universal property: for every simplicial set $S_\bullet$, Yoneda's lemma supplies a bijection
\[\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_{\Delta}}(\Delta^n,S_\bullet)\cong S_n.\]
We often invoke this bijection implicitly to identify $n$-simplices of $S_\bullet$ with maps of simplicial sets $\sigma:\Delta^n\to S_\bullet$.
\begin{example}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set and let $v$ be a vertex of $S_\bullet$. Then $v$ can be identified with a map of simplicial sets $\Delta^0\to S_\bullet$. This map is automatically a monomorphism (note that $\Delta^0$ has only a single $n$-simplex for every $n\geq 0$), whose image is a simplicial subset of $S_\bullet$. It will often be convenient to denote this simplicial subset by $\{v\}$. For example, since $\Delta^n([0])=\Hom_{\Delta}([0],[n])$, we can identify the vertices of the standard $n$-simplex $\Delta^n$ with the set $[n]$: every integer $0\leq i\leq n$ determines a simplicial subset $\{i\}\sub\Delta^n$ whose $k$-simplices are the constant maps $[k]\to[n]$ taking the value $i$.
\end{example}
Let $n\geq 0$ be an integer. We define a simplicial set $(\partial\Delta^n)$ by the formula
\[(\partial\Delta^n)([m])=\{\alpha\in\Hom_{\Delta}([m],[n]):\text{$\alpha$ is not surjective}\}.\]
Note that we can regard $\partial\Delta^n$ as a simplicial subset of the standard $n$-simplex $\Delta^n$. It is called the \textbf{boundary} of $\partial\Delta^n$. 
\begin{example}
We can think of the boundary $\partial\Delta^n$ as obtained from the $n$-simplex $\Delta^n$ by removing its interior. It is clear that $\partial\Delta^0=\emp$. Now for $0\leq i\leq n$, the map $\delta^i:[n-1]\to[n]$ determines a map of simplicial sets $\Delta^{n-1}\to\Delta^n$ which factors through the simplicial subset $\partial\Delta^n\sub\Delta^n$. We therefore obtain a map of simplicial sets $\Delta^{n-1}\to\partial\Delta^n$, which is also denoted by $\delta^i$. Now let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set, and consider the injective map
\[\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\partial\Delta^n,S_\bullet)\to\prod_{i\in[n]}S_{n-1},\quad (f:\partial\Delta^n\to S_\bullet)\mapsto\{f\circ\delta^i\}_{0\leq i\leq n}\]
where we use Yoneda's lemma to identify $\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Delta^{n-1},S_\bullet)$ with $S_{n-1}$. The image of this map is the collection of sequences of $(n-1)$-simplicies $(\sigma_0,\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_n)$ satisfying the identities $d_i(\sigma_j)=d_{j-1}(\sigma_i)$ for $0\leq i<j\leq n$.
\end{example}
Suppose we are given integers $0\leq i\leq n$. We define a simplicial set $\Lambda_i^n$ by the formula
\[(\Lambda_i^n)([m])=\{\alpha\in\Hom_{\Delta}([m],[n]):\alpha([m])\cup\{i\}\neq[n]\}.\]
We can consider $\Lambda_i^n$ as a simplicial subset of the boundary $\partial\Delta^n\sub\Delta^n$. It is called the $i$-th \textbf{horn} in $\Delta^n$. We say that $\Lambda_i^n$ is an \textbf{inner horn} if $0<i<n$, and an \textbf{outer horn} if $i=0$ or $n$.
\begin{example}\label{simplicial set horn description}
Roughly speaking, one can think of the horn $\Lambda_i^n$ as obtained from the $n$-simplex $\Delta^n$ by removing its interior together with the face opposite its $i$-th vertex. For example, the horns contained in $\Delta^2$ are depicted in the following diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=12mm,column sep=8mm]
&\{1\}\ar[d,phantom,"\Lambda_0^2"]\ar[rd,dashed]&\\
\{0\}\ar[ru]\ar[rr]&{}&\{2\}
\end{tikzcd}\quad \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=12mm,column sep=8mm]
&\{1\}\ar[d,phantom,"\Lambda_1^2"]\ar[rd]&\\
\{0\}\ar[ru]\ar[rr,dashed]&{}&\{2\}
\end{tikzcd}\quad \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=12mm,column sep=8mm]
&\{1\}\ar[d,phantom,"\Lambda_2^2"]\ar[rd]&\\
\{0\}\ar[ru,dashed]\ar[rr]&{}&\{2\}
\end{tikzcd}\]
Here the dotted arrows indicate edges of $\Delta^2$ which are not contained in the corresponding horn.\par
Now let $0\leq i\leq n$ be integers. For $j\in[n]\setminus\{i\}$, the map $\delta^j$ can be regarded as a map of simplicial sets from $\Delta^{n-1}$ to $\Lambda_i^n\sub\Delta^n$. For any simplicial set $S_\bullet$, we can therefore consider the injective map
\[\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Lambda_i^n,S_\bullet)\to\prod_{j\in[n]\setminus\{i\}}S_{n-1},\quad (f:\Lambda_i^n,S_\bullet)\mapsto\{f\circ\delta^j\}_{j\in[n]\setminus\{i\}}.\]
It is not hard to see that the image of this map is the collection of "imcomplete" sequences $(\sigma_0,\dots,\sigma_{i-1},\ast,\sigma_{i+1},\dots,\sigma_n)$ satisfying $d_j(\sigma_k)=d_{k-1}(\sigma_j)$ for $j,k\in[n]\setminus\{i\}$, $j<k$.
\end{example}
\subsection{The skeletal filtration}
Roughly speaking, one can think of the simplicial sets $\Delta^n$ as  elementary building blocks out of which more complicated simplicial sets can be constructed. In this subsection, we make this idea more precise by introducing the skeletal filtration of a simplicial set. This filtration allows us to write every simplicial set $S_\bullet$ as the union of an increasing sequence of simplicial subsets
\[\sk_0(S_\bullet)\sub \sk_1(S_\bullet)\sub\cdots\sub \sk_n(S_\bullet)\sub\cdots\]
where each $\sk_n(S_\bullet)$ is obtained from $\sk_{n-1}(S_\bullet)$ by attaching copies of $\Delta^n$. Before doing this, we need some preparations.
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set n-simplex image of n-1 iff}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set and $\tau\in S_n$ be an $n$-simplex of $S_\bullet$ for $n>0$, which is also considered as a map $\tau:\Delta^n\to S_\bullet$. Then the following are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(\rmnum{1})] The simplex $\tau$ belongs to the image of the degeneracy map $s_i:S_{n-1}\to S_n$ for some $0\leq i\leq n-1$.
\item[(\rmnum{2})] The map $\tau$ factors as a composition $\Delta^{n}\stackrel{f}{\to}\Delta^{n-1}\to S_\bullet$, where $f$ corresponds to a surjective map of linearly ordered sets $[n]\to[n-1]$.
\item[(\rmnum{3})] The map $\tau$ factors as a composition $\Delta^{n}\stackrel{f}{\to}\Delta^{m}\to S_\bullet$, where $f$ corresponds to a surjective map of linearly ordered sets $[n]\to[m]$.
\item[(\rmnum{4})] The map $\tau$ factors as a composition $\Delta^n\to\Delta^m\to S_\bullet$ where $m<n$.
\item[(\rmnum{5})] The map $\tau$ factors as a composition $\Delta^{n}\stackrel{\tau'}{\to}\Delta^{m}\to S_\bullet$, where $\tau'$ is not injective on vertices.
\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The implications (\rmnum{1})$\Leftrightarrow$(\rmnum{2})$\Rightarrow$(\rmnum{3})$\Rightarrow$(\rmnum{4})$\Rightarrow$(\rmnum{5}) are immediate. We now show that (\rmnum{5})$\Rightarrow$(\rmnum{1}). Assume that $\tau$ factors into $\Delta^{n}\stackrel{\tau'}{\to}\Delta^{m}\to S_\bullet$, where $\tau'$ is not injective on vertices. Then there exists some integer $0\leq i<n$ satisfying $\tau'(i)=\tau'(i+1)$. It follows that $\tau'$ factors through the map $\sigma^i:\Delta^n\to\Delta^{n-1}$ of, so that $\tau$ belongs to the image of the degeneracy map $s_i$.
\end{proof}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set and let $\sigma:\Delta^n\to S_\bullet$ be an $n$-simplex of $S_\bullet$. We say that $\sigma$ is \textbf{degenerate} if $n>0$ and $\sigma$ satisfies the equivalent conditions of \cref{simplicial set n-simplex image of n-1 iff}; otherwise $\sigma$ is said to be \textbf{nondegenerate} (in particular, every $0$-simplex of $S_\bullet$ is nondegenerate).
\begin{example}
Let $f:S_\bullet\to T_\bullet$ be a map of simplicial sets. If $\sigma$ is a degenerate $n$-simplex of $S_\bullet$, then $f(\sigma)$ is a degenerate $n$-simplex of $T_\bullet$. The converse holds if $f$ is a monomorphism of simplicial sets (for example, if $S_\bullet$ is a simplicial subset of $T_\bullet$).
\end{example}
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set map from Delta^n factorization}
Let $\sigma:\Delta^n\to S_\bullet$ be a map of simplicial sets. Then $\sigma$ can be factored uniquely as a composition
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\Delta^n\ar[r,"\alpha"]&\Delta^m\ar[r,"\tau"]&S_\bullet
\end{tikzcd}\]
where $\alpha$ corresponds to a surjective map of linearly ordered sets $[n]\to[m]$ and $\tau$ is a nondegenerate $m$-simplex of $S_\bullet$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $m$ be the smallest nonnegative integer for which $\sigma$ can be factored as a composition $\Delta^n\stackrel{\alpha}{\to}\Delta^m\stackrel{\tau}{\to}S_\bullet$. It follows from the minimality of $m$ that $\alpha$ must induce a surjection of linearly ordered sets $[n]\to[m]$ (otherwise, we could replace $[m]$ by the image of $\alpha$) and that the $m$-simplex $\tau$ is nondegenerate. This proves the existence of the desired factorization.\par
Suppose we are given another factorization of $\sigma$ as a
composition $\Delta^n\stackrel{\alpha'}{\to}\Delta^{m'}\stackrel{\tau'}{\to}S_\bullet$, and assume that $\alpha'$ induces a surjection $[n]\to[m']$. We first prove that for any pair of integers $0\leq i<j\leq n$ satisfying $\alpha'(i)=\alpha'(j)$, we also have $\alpha(i)=\alpha(j)$. Assume otherwise; then $\alpha$ admits a section $\beta:\Delta^m\hookrightarrow\Delta^n$ whose images include $i$ and $j$, and we have
\[\tau=\tau\circ\alpha\circ\beta=\sigma\circ\beta=\tau'\circ\alpha'\circ\beta.\]
Our assumption that $\alpha'(i)=\alpha'(j)$ guarantees that the map $(\alpha'\circ\beta):\Delta^m\to\Delta^{m'}$ is not injective on vertices, contradicting to the fact that $\tau$ is nondegenerate.\par
Now it follows from the preceding argument that $\alpha$ factors uniquely as a composition $\Delta^n\stackrel{\alpha'}{\to}\Delta^{m'}\stackrel{\eta}{\to}\Delta^m$, for some morphism $\eta:\Delta^{m'}\to\Delta^m$ (which is also surjective on vertices). Let $\beta'$ be a section of $\alpha'$, and note that we have
\[\tau'=\tau'\circ\alpha'\circ\beta'=\sigma\circ\beta'=\tau\circ\alpha\circ\beta'=\tau\circ\eta\circ\alpha'\circ\beta'=\tau\circ\eta.\]
Consequently, if the simplex $\tau'$ is nondegenerate, then $\eta$ must also be injective on vertices. It follows that $m'=m$ and $\eta$ is the identity map, so $\alpha=\alpha'$ and $\tau=\tau'$.
\end{proof}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set, $k\geq-1$ be an integer, and $\sigma:\Delta^n\to S_\bullet$ be an $n$-simplex of $S_\bullet$. The proof of \cref{simplicial set map from Delta^n factorization} shows that the following conditions are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Let $\Delta^n\stackrel{\alpha}{\to}\Delta^m\stackrel{\tau}{\to}S_\bullet$ be the factorization of \cref{simplicial set map from Delta^n factorization} (so that $\alpha$ induces a surjection $[n]\to[m]$, the map $\tau$ is nondegenerate, and $\sigma=\tau\circ\alpha$). Then $m\leq k$.
\item[(b)] There exists a factorization $\Delta^n\to\Delta^{m'}\to S_\bullet$ of $\sigma$ for which $m'\leq k$.
\end{itemize}
For each positive integer $n\geq 0$, we denote by $\sk_k(S_n)$ the subset of $S_n$ consisting of those $n$-simplices which satisfy the equivalent conditions above. In view of condition (b), the collection of subsets $\{\sk_k(S_n)\}_{n\geq 0}$ is stable under the face and degeneracy operators of $S_\bullet$, and therefore determine a simplicial subset of $S_\bullet$. This simplicial subset is denoted by $\sk_k(S_\bullet)$ and called the \textbf{$\bm{k}$-skeleton} of $S_\bullet$.\par
By definition, it is clear that $\sk_k(S_n)$ contains every $n$-simplex of $S_\bullet$ if $n\leq k$. In particular, $\bigcup_{k\geq 0}\sk_k(S_\bullet)$ is equal to $S_\bullet$, so the collection $\{\sk_k(S_\bullet)\}_{k\geq-1}$ is a filtration of $S_\bullet$. We also note that a nondegenerate $n$-simplex $\sigma$ of $S_\bullet$ is contained in a skeleton $\sk_k(S_\bullet)$ if and only if $n\leq k$.\par
We define the \textbf{dimension} of a simpliciat set $S_\bullet$ to be the smallest integer $k$ such that for every integer $n>k$, every $n$-simplex of $S_\bullet$ is degenerate. A simplicial set $S_\bullet$ is said to be \textbf{finite-dimensional} if it has dimension $\leq k$ for some $k\gg 0$. Using the dimension of $S_\bullet$, we can now prove the following universal property for skeletons of $S_\bullet$.
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set skeleton universal prop}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set and $k\geq -1$ be an integer.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] The simplicial set $\sk_k(S_\bullet)$ has dimension $\leq k$.
\item[(b)] For every simplicial set $T_\bullet$ of dimension $\leq k$, composition with the inclusion map $\sk_k(S_\bullet)\hookrightarrow S_\bullet$ induces a bijection
\[\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(T_\bullet,\sk_k(S_\bullet))\to\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(T_\bullet,S_\bullet).\]
In other words, any map of simplicial sets $T_\bullet\to S_\bullet$ factors through $\sk_k(S_\bullet)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The first assertion is clear. To prove (b), suppose that $f:T_\bullet\to S_\bullet$ is a map of simplicial sets, where $T_\bullet$ has dimension $\leq k$. We wish to show that $f$ carries every $n$-simplex $\sigma$ of $T_\bullet$ to an $n$-simplex of $\sk_k(S_\bullet)$. Using \cref{simplicial set map from Delta^n factorization}, we can reduce to the case where $\sigma$ is a nondegenerate $n$-simplex of $T_\bullet$. In this case, our assumption that $T_\bullet$ has dimension $\leq k$ guarantees that $n\leq k$, so that $f(\sigma)$ belongs to $\sk_k(S_\bullet)$ be the definition of $\sk_k(S_\bullet)$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set dimension of product}
Let $S_\bullet$ and $S'_\bullet$ be simplicial sets of dimension $k$ and $k'$, respectively. Then the product $S_\bullet\times S'_\bullet$ is of dimension $k+k'$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $(\sigma,\sigma')$ be a nondegenerate $n$-simplex of the product $S_\bullet\times S'_\bullet$. Using \cref{simplicial set map from Delta^n factorization}, we see that $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$ admit factorizations
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\Delta^n\ar[r,"\alpha"]&\Delta^{m}\ar[r,"\tau"]&S_\bullet
\end{tikzcd}\quad \begin{tikzcd}
\Delta^n\ar[r,"\alpha'"]&\Delta^{m'}\ar[r,"\tau'"]&S'_\bullet
\end{tikzcd}\]
where $\tau$ and $\tau'$ are nondegenerate, so that $m\leq k$, $m'\leq k'$. It follows that $(\sigma,\sigma')$ factors as a composition
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\Delta^n\ar[r,"{(\alpha,\alpha')}"]&\Delta^m\times\Delta^{m'}\ar[r,"{\tau\times\tau'}"]&S_\bullet\times S'_\bullet
\end{tikzcd}\]
The nondegeneracy of $\eta$ guarantees that the map of partially ordered sets $[n]\stackrel{(\alpha,\alpha')}{\to}[m]\times[m']$ is a monomorphism, so that $n\leq m+m'\leq k+k'$. Thus we have shown that the dimension of $S_\bullet\times S_\bullet'$ is $\leq k+k'$.\par
On the other hand, since $\dim(S_\bullet)=k$, $\dim(S_\bullet')=k'$, there exists nondegenerate simplicies $\sigma:\Delta^k\to S_\bullet$ and $\sigma':\Delta^{k'}\to S_\bullet'$. We consider the unique factorization
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\Delta^k\times\Delta^{k'}\ar[r,"\beta"]&\Delta^m\ar[r,"\gamma"]&S_\bullet\times S_\bullet'
\end{tikzcd}\]
of $\sigma\times\sigma'$, where $\gamma$ is nondegenerate. By projecting onto $S_\bullet$ and $S'_\bullet$, we obtain factorizations
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\Delta^k\ar[r,"\beta_1"]&\Delta^m\ar[r,"\gamma_1"]&S_\bullet
\end{tikzcd},\quad\begin{tikzcd}
\Delta^{k'}\ar[r,"\beta_2"]&\Delta^m\ar[r,"\gamma_2"]&S'_\bullet
\end{tikzcd}\]
of $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$, respectively. Since $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$ are nondegenerate, the maps $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are necessarily monomorphisms, and thus so is their product $\beta:\Delta^k\times\Delta^{k'}\to\Delta^m$. This implies $m\geq k+k'$, and so $\sigma\times\sigma'$ is nondegenerate. We then conclude that $\dim(S_\bullet\times S'_\bullet)=k+k'$.
\end{proof}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set. For each $k\geq 0$, we let $S_k^{\circ}$ denote the collection of all \textit{nondegenerate} $k$-simplices of $S_\bullet$. Every element $\sigma\in S_k^{\circ}$ determines a map of simplicial sets $\Delta^k\to\sk_k(S_\bullet)$. Since the boundary $\partial\Delta^k\sub\Delta^k$ has dimension $\leq k-1$, this map carries $\partial\Delta^k$ into the $(k-1)$-skeleton $\sk_{k-1}(S_\bullet)$.
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set skeleton pushout square}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set and let $k\geq 0$. Then we have a pushout square
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\coprod_{\sigma\in S_k^{\circ}}\partial\Delta^k\ar[r]\ar[d]&\coprod_{\sigma\in S_k^{\circ}}\Delta^k\ar[d]\\
\sk_{k-1}(S_\bullet)\ar[r]&\sk_k(S_\bullet)
\end{tikzcd}\]
in the category $\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$ of simplicial sets.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Unwinding the definitions, we only need to prove the following: Let $\tau$ be an $n$-simplex of $\sk_k(S_\bullet)$ which is not contained in $\sk_{k-1}(S_\bullet)$, then $\tau$ factors uniquely as a composition
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\Delta^n\ar[r,"\alpha"]&\Delta^k\ar[r,"\sigma"]&S_\bullet
\end{tikzcd}\]
where $\sigma$ is a nondegenerate simplex of $S_\bullet$ and $\alpha$ does not factor through the boundary $\partial\Delta^k$ (in other words, $\alpha$ induces a surjection of linearly ordered sets $[n]\to[k]$). Now \cref{simplicial set map from Delta^n factorization} implies that any $n$-simplex of $S_\bullet$ admits a unique factorization $\Delta^n\stackrel{\alpha}{\to}\Delta^m\stackrel{\sigma}{\to}S_\bullet$, where $\alpha$ is surjective and $\sigma$ is nondegenerate. Our assumption that $\tau$ belongs to the $\sk_k(S_\bullet)$ guarantees that $m\leq k$, and that $\tau$ does not belong to $\sk_{k-1}(S_\bullet)$ implies that $m\geq k$.
\end{proof}
\subsection{Discrete simplicial sets}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category. For each object $C\in\mathcal{C}$, we let $\uline{C}_\bullet$ denote the constant functor $\Delta\to\{C\}\hookrightarrow\mathcal{C}$ taking the value $C$ on objects and identity morphism $1_C$ on morphisms. We regard $C_\bullet$ as a simplicial object of $\mathcal{C}$, which is called the \textbf{constant simplicial object with value $\bm{C}$}. The constant simplicial object $\uline{C}_\bullet$ can be characterized by a universal property:
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set constant universal prop}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category and let $C$ be an object of $\mathcal{C}$. For any simplicial object $S_\bullet$ of $\mathcal{C}$, the canonical map
\[\Hom_{\Fun(\Delta^{\op},\mathcal{C})}(\uline{C}_\bullet,S_\bullet)\to\Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(C,S_0)\]
is a bijection.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $f:C\to S_0$ be a morphism in $\mathcal{C}$; we want to show that $f$ can be extended uniquely to a map of simplicial sets $f_\bullet:\uline{C}_\bullet\to S_\bullet$. For this, we define $f_\bullet$ be the natural transformation whose value on an object $[n]\in\Delta^{\op}$ is given by the composite map
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\uline{C}_n=C\ar[r,"f"]&S_0\ar[r,"S_{\alpha(n)}"]&S_n
\end{tikzcd}\]
where $\alpha(n)$ denotes the unique morphism in $\Delta$ from $[n]$ to $[0]$. To prove the naturality of $f_\bullet$, we observe that for any nondecreasing map $\beta:[m]\to[n]$, we have a commutative diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\uline{C}_n\ar[r,equal]\ar[d,"\uline{C}_\beta"]&C\ar[r,"f"]\ar[d,equal]&S_0\ar[r,"S_{\alpha(n)}"]\ar[d,equal]&S_n\ar[d,"S_\beta"]\\
\uline{C}_m\ar[r,equal]&C\ar[r,"f"]&S_0\ar[r,"S_{\alpha(m)}"]&S_m
\end{tikzcd}\]
where the commutativity of the square on the right follows from the observation that $\alpha(m)$ is equal to the composition $[m]\stackrel{\beta}{\to}[n]\stackrel{\alpha(n)}{\to}[0]$.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}\label{simplicial set limit of S_n isomorphic to S_0}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category. Then for any simplicial object $S_\bullet$ of $\mathcal{C}$, the limit $\llim_{[n]\in\Delta^{\op}}S_n$ exists in the category $\mathcal{C}$ and is isomorphic to $S_0$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
This follows from \cref{simplicial set constant universal prop} by noting that a map $\uline{C}_\bullet\to S_\bullet$ consists of morphisms $C\to S_n$ satisfying compatible conditions. Alternatively, this can be deduced formally from the observation that $[0]$ is a final object of the category $\Delta$ (and therefore an initial object of the category $\Delta^{\op}$).
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}\label{simplicial set evaluation adjoint to constant functor}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category. Then the evaluation functor
\[\ev_0:\Fun(\Delta^{\op},\mathcal{C})\to\mathcal{C},\quad S_\bullet\to S_0\]
admits a left adjoint, given on objects by the formation of constant simplicial objects $C\mapsto\uline{C}_\bullet$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{corollary}\label{simplicial set constant functor is embedding}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category. Then the construction $C\mapsto\uline{C}_\bullet$ determines a fully faithful embedding from $\mathcal{C}$ to the category $\Fun(\Delta^{\op},\mathcal{C})$ of simplicial objects of $\mathcal{C}$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
If $C$ and $D$ are objects of $\mathcal{C}$, we want to show that the canonical map
\[\theta:\Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(C,D)\to\Hom_{\Fun(\Delta^{\op},\mathcal{C})}(\uline{C}_\bullet,\uline{D}_\bullet)\]
is bijective. This is clear since $\theta$ is the right inverse to the evaluation map
\[\Hom_{\Fun(\Delta^{\op},\mathcal{C})}(\uline{C}_\bullet,\uline{D}_\bullet)\to\Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(C,D)\]
which is bijective in view of \cref{simplicial set constant universal prop}.
\end{proof}
In particular, if we take $\mathcal{C}=\mathbf{Set}$, then there is an embedding of $\mathbf{Set}$ to $\mathbf{Set}_{\Delta}$ given by $X\mapsto\uline{X}_\bullet$. Given this, we say that a simplicial set $S_\bullet$ is \textbf{discrete} if there exists a set $X$ such that $S_\bullet\cong\uline{X}_\bullet$. It is clear that the following corollary is true.
\begin{corollary}\label{simplicial set constant functor image is discrete}
The functor $X\mapsto\uline{X}_\bullet$ determines a fully faithful embedding $\mathbf{Set}\to\mathbf{Set}_{\Delta}$ whose essential image is the full subcategory of $\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$ spanned by the discrete simplicial sets.
\end{corollary}
Let $S$ be a set. We will often abuse notation by identifying $S$ with the constant simplicial set $\uline{S}_\bullet$. This abuse will occur most frequently in the special case where $S=\{v\}$ consists of a single vertex $v$ of some other simplicial set $X_\bullet$. In this case, we view $\{v\}$ as a simplicial subset of $X_\bullet$ which is abstractly isomorphic to $\Delta^0$.
\begin{remark}
The fully faithful embedding $\mathbf{Set}\to\mathbf{Set}_\Delta,S\mapsto\uline{S}_\bullet$ preserves (small) limits and colimits (since limits and colimits of simplicial sets are computed levelwise). It follows that the collection of discrete simplicial sets is closed under the formation of (small) limits and colimits in $\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$.
\end{remark}
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set discrete iff}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set. The following conditions are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(\rmnum{1})] $S_\bullet$ is discrete.
\item[(\rmnum{2})] For every morphism $\alpha:[m]\to[n]$ in the category $\Delta$, the induced map $S_n\to S_m$ is a bijection.
\item[(\rmnum{3})] For every positive integer $n$, the $0$-th face map $d_0:S_n\to S_{n-1}$ is a bijection.
\item[(\rmnum{4})] $S_\bullet$ is of zero dimension.   
\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The implication (\rmnum{1})$\Rightarrow$(\rmnum{2}) follows from the definition of $\uline{X}_\bullet$, and the implication (\rmnum{2})$\Rightarrow$(\rmnum{3}) is immediate. To prove that (\rmnum{3})$\Rightarrow$(\rmnum{4}), we observe that if the face map $d_0:S_n\to S_{n-1}$ is bijective, then the degeneracy operator $s_0:S_{n-1}\to S_n$ is also bijective (since it is a right inverse of $d_0$). In particular, $s_0$ is surjective, so every $n$-simplex of $S_\bullet$ is degenerate by \cref{simplicial set n-simplex image of n-1 iff}.\par
We complete the proof by showing that (\rmnum{4})$\Rightarrow$(\rmnum{1}). If $S_\bullet$ is a simplicial set of dimension $0$ and $X=S_0$ is the set of vertices of $S_\bullet$, then \cref{simplicial set skeleton pushout square} supplies an isomorphism of simplicial sets $\amalg_{v\in X}\Delta^0\cong S_\bullet$, whose domain can be identified with the constant simplicial set $\uline{X}_\bullet$.
\end{proof}
\begin{example}\label{simplicial set from adjoint pair}
Let $F:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$ and $G:\mathcal{D}\to\mathcal{C}$ be functors between categories such that $(F,G)$ is an adjoint pair. In this case, we have two natural transformations
\[\eta:1_{\mathcal{C}}\to GF,\quad \eps:FG\to 1_{\mathcal{D}}.\]
We write $L=FG$ and $\delta=F\eta G$, so that $\eps:L\to 1$ is the counit map and $\delta:L\to L^2$ is the comultiplication. Now suppose that $D$ is any fixed object in $\mathcal{D}$ and set $S_n=L^{n+1}(D)$ for each positive integer $n\geq 0$. For any integer $0\leq i\leq n$, the counit map $\eps$ then gives face morphisms
\[d_i=L^{n-i}\eps L^i(D):L^{n+1}(D)\to L^n(D),\]
whilst the comultiplication gives degeneracy morphisms
\[s_i=L^{n-1-i}\delta L^i:L^n(D)\to L^{n+1}(D).\]
It can be verify that the $d_i$ and $s_i$ satisfy simplicial identities, so we obtain a simplicial object $S_\bullet$ of $\mathcal{D}$. Note that we have an agumentation map $S_\bullet\to\uline{D}_\bullet$ given by the counit map $\eps_D:L(D)\to D$.
\end{example}
We now generalize \cref{simplicial set discrete iff} to obtain a concrete description of simplicial sets of dimension $\leq 1$. But for this, let us recall that a directed graph $G$ is by definition the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item A set $V(G)$ of \textbf{verticies} of $G$.
\item A set $E(G)$ of \textbf{edges} of $G$.
\item A pair of functions $s,t:E(G)\to V(G)$ which assign to each edge $e\in E(G)$ a pair of vertices $s(e),t(e)\in V(G)$, called the \textbf{source} and \textbf{target} of $e$, respectively.
\end{itemize}
Let $G$ and $G'$ be directed graphs. A \textbf{morphism} from $G$ to $G'$ is a function $f:V(G)\amalg E(G)\to V(G')\amalg E(G')$ which satisfies the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item For each vertex $v\in V(G)$, the image $f(v)$ belongs to $V(G')$.
\item Let $e\in E(G)$ be an edge of $G$ with source $v=s(e)$ and target $w=t(e)$. Then the image $f(e)$ is either an edge of $G'$ having source $s(f(e))=f(v)$ and target $t(f(e))=f(w)$, or a vertex of $G'$ satisfying $f(v)=f(e)=f(w)$.
\end{itemize}
We let $\mathbf{Graph}$ denote the category whose objects are directed graphs and whose morphisms are morphisms of directed graphs (with composition defined in the evident way). We now construct a functor from $\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$ to $\mathbf{Graph}$. To every simplicial set $S_\bullet$, we can associate a directed graph $\Gamma(S_\bullet)$ as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item The vertex set $V(\Gamma(S_\bullet))$ is the set of $0$-simplices of $S_\bullet$.
\item The edge set $E(\Gamma(S_\bullet))$ is the set of nondegenerate $1$-simplcies of $S_\bullet$.
\item For every edge $e\in E(\Gamma(S_\bullet))\sub S_1$, the source $s(e)$ is the vertex $d_1(e)$, and the target $t(e)$ is the vertex $d_0(e)$ (here $d_0,d_1$ are the face maps).
\end{itemize}
Note that the disjoint union $V(\Gamma(S_\bullet))\amalg E(\Gamma(S_\bullet))$ can be identified with the set $S_1$ of all $1$-simplices of $S_\bullet$ (where we identify $V(\Gamma(S_\bullet))$ with the collection of degenerate $1$-simplices via the degeneracy map $s_0:S_0\to S_1$).
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set graph functor def}
Let $f:S_\bullet\to T_\bullet$ be a map of simplicial sets. Then the induced map
\[\begin{tikzcd}
V(\Gamma(S_\bullet))\amalg E(\Gamma(S_\bullet))\cong S_1\ar[r,"f"]&T_1\cong V(\Gamma(T_\bullet))\amalg E(\Gamma(T_\bullet))
\end{tikzcd}\]
is a morphism of directed graphs from $\Gamma(S_\bullet)$ to $\Gamma(T_\bullet)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Since $f$ commutes with the degeneracy operator $s_0$, it carries degenerate $1$-simplices of $S_\bullet$ to degenerate $1$-simplices of $T_\bullet$, and therefore takes vertices to vertices. The second condition follows from the fact that $f$ commutes with the face operators $d_0$ and $d_1$.
\end{proof}
From Propotision~\ref{simplicial set graph functor def}, the construction $S_\bullet\mapsto\Gamma(S_\bullet)$ is a functor from $\mathbf{Set}_\Delta\to\mathbf{Graph}$. We shall use this functor to characterize simplicial sets of dimension $\leq 1$.
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set graph functor on dim 1 faithful}
Let $S_\bullet$ and $T_\bullet$ be simplicial sets. If $S_\bullet$ has dimension $\leq 1$, then the canonical map
\[\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(S_\bullet,T_\bullet)\to\Hom_{\mathbf{Graph}}(\Gamma(S_\bullet),\Gamma(T_\bullet))\]
is bijective.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
If $S_\bullet$ has dimension $\leq 1$, then \cref{simplicial set skeleton pushout square} provides a pushout diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\coprod_{e\in E(\Gamma(S_\bullet))}\partial\Delta^1\ar[r]\ar[d]&\coprod_{e\in E(\Gamma(S_\bullet))}\ar[d]\\
\coprod_{v\in V(\Gamma(S_\bullet))}\Delta^0\ar[r]&S_\bullet
\end{tikzcd}\]
It then follows that, for any simplicial set $T_\bullet$, we can identify $\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(S_\bullet,T_\bullet)$ with the fiber product
\[\Big(\prod_{e\in E(\Gamma(S_\bullet))}T_1\Big)\times_{\prod_{e\in E(\Gamma(S_\bullet))}(T_0\times T_0)}\Big(\prod_{v\in V(\Gamma(S_\bullet))}T_0\Big)\]
which is precisely the set of morphisms of directed graphs from $\Gamma(S_\bullet)$ to $\Gamma(T_\bullet)$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set graph functor equivalence to dim 1}
Let $\mathbf{Set}^{\leq 1}_{\Delta}\sub\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$ denote the full subcategory spanned by the simplicial sets of dimension $\leq 1$. Then the functor $S_\bullet\mapsto\Gamma(S_\bullet)$ induces an equivalence of categories $\mathbf{Set}_\Delta^{\leq 1}\to\mathbf{Graph}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
It follows from \cref{simplicial set graph functor on dim 1 faithful} that the functor $S_\bullet\to\Gamma(S_\bullet)$ is fully faithful when restricted to simplicial sets of dimension $\leq 1$. It will therefore suffice to show that it is essentially surjective. Let $G$ be any directed graph, and form a pushout diagram of simplicial sets
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\coprod_{e\in E(G)}\partial\Delta^1\ar[r]\ar[d]&\coprod_{e\in E(G)}\ar[d]\\
\coprod_{v\in V(G)}\Delta^0\ar[r]&S_\bullet
\end{tikzcd}\]
Then $S_\bullet$ is a simplicial set of dimension $\leq 1$, and the directed graph $\Gamma(S_\bullet)$ is isomorphic to $G$.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}\label{simplicial set graph functor description}
The proof of \cref{simplicial set graph functor equivalence to dim 1} gives an explicit description of the inverse equivalence $\mathbf{Graph}\to\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$: it carries a directed graph $G$ to the $1$-dimensional simplicial set $G_\bullet$ given by the pushout
\[\Big(\coprod_{v\in V(G)}\Delta^0\Big)\coprod_{\coprod_{e\in E(G)}\partial\Delta^1}\Big(\coprod_{e\in E(G)}\Delta^1\Big)\]
\end{remark}
\begin{example}
Let $G$ be a directed graph and let $G_\bullet$ denote the associated simplicial set of dimension $\leq 1$ (by \cref{simplicial set graph functor equivalence to dim 1}). Then $G_\bullet$ has dimension $\leq 0$ if and only if the edge set $E(G)$ is empty. In this case, $G_\bullet$ can be identified with the constant simplicial set associated to the vertex set $V(G)$.
\end{example}
\subsection{Connected components of simplicial sets}
We now introduce the notion of a \textit{connected simplicial set}, and show that any simplicial set $S_\bullet$ can be decomposed into a disjoint union of connected simplicial subsets, indexed by a set $\pi_0(S_\bullet)$, which is called the \textit{set of connected components} of $S_\bullet$. Also, we will see that the functor $S_\bullet\to\pi_0(S_\bullet)$ is a left adjoint to the functor $X\mapsto\uline{X}_\bullet$.\par
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set and $S'_\bullet\sub S_\bullet$ be a simplicial subset of $S_\bullet$. We say that $S'_\bullet$ is a \textbf{summand} of $S_\bullet$ if $S_\bullet$ can be written into a coproduct $S'_\bullet\amalg S''_\bullet$ for some simplicial subset $S''_\bullet$ of $S_\bullet$. In this case, the complementray $S''_\bullet$ is uniquely determined: for each $n\geq 0$, we must have $S''_n=S_n\setminus S'_n$, so the condition that $S'_\bullet$ is a summand of $S_\bullet$ is equivalent to the condition that the map
\[([n]\in\Delta^{\op})\mapsto S_n\setminus S'_n\]
is functorial: that is, that the face and degeneracy operators for the simplicial set $S_\bullet$ preserve the subsets $S_n\setminus S'_n$.
\begin{remark}\label{simplicial set summand prop}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set. Then it is clear that the collection of all summands of $S_\bullet$ is closed under the formation of unions and intersections. Moreover, if $S'_\bullet\sub S_\bullet$ is a summand of $S_\bullet$ and $S''_\bullet\sub S'_\bullet$ is a summand of $T_\bullet$, then $S''_\bullet$ is a summand of $S_\bullet$.\par
Finally, if $f:S_\bullet\to T_\bullet$ is a map of simplicial sets and $T'_\bullet\sub T_\bullet$ is a sumand, then the inverse image $f^{-1}(T_\bullet)\cong S_\bullet\times_{T_\bullet}T'_\bullet$ is a summand of $S_\bullet$.
\end{remark}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set. We say that $S_\bullet$ is \textbf{connected} if it is nonempty and every summand of $S_\bullet$ is either empty or coincides with $S_\bullet$. We say a simplicial subset $S'_\bullet\sub S_\bullet$ is a connected component of $S_\bullet$ if $S'_\bullet$ is connected and is a summand of $S_\bullet$. We denote by $\pi_0(S_\bullet)$ the set of connected components of $S_\bullet$. It often will be convenient to view $I=\pi_0(S_\bullet)$ as an abstract index set which is equipped with a bijection
\[I\cong\{\text{connected components of $S_\bullet$}\},\quad I\ni i\mapsto S^{(i)}_\bullet\sub S_\bullet\]
rather than as the set of connected components itself.
\begin{example}\label{simplicial set constant pi_0 char}
Let $X$ be a set and $\uline{X}_\bullet$ be the constant simplicial set associated to $X$. Then the connected components of $\uline{X}_\bullet$ are exactly the simplicial subsets of the form $\{x\}=\uline{\{x\}}_\bullet$. In particular, we have a canonical bijection $X\cong\pi_0(\uline{X}_\bullet)$.
\end{example}
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set connected image is connected}
Let $f:S_\bullet\to T_\bullet$ be a map of simplicial sets, and suppose that $S_\bullet$ is connected. Then there exists a unique connected component $T'_\bullet\sub T_\bullet$ such that $f(S_\bullet)\sub T'_\bullet$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $T'_\bullet$ be the smallest summand of $T_\bullet$ which contains the image of f (the existence of $T'_\bullet$ follows from \cref{simplicial set summand prop}: we can take $T'_\bullet$ to be the intersection of all those summands of $T_\bullet$ which contain the image of $f$). It then suffices to prove that $T'_\bullet$ is connected. Since $S_\bullet$ is nonempty, $T'_\bullet$ is also nonempty; now let $T''_\bullet\sub T'_\bullet$ be a summand. Note that $f^{-1}(T''_\bullet)$ is then a summand of $S_\bullet$, so $f^{-1}(T''_\bullet)$ is equal to $\emp$ or $S_\bullet$. By replacing $T''_\bullet$ with its complement in $T'_\bullet$ if necessary, we may assume that $f^{-1}(T''_\bullet)=S_\bullet$, so that $f$ factors through $T''_\bullet$. Since $T''_\bullet$ is a summand of $T_\bullet$, from the minimality of $T'_\bullet$ we must have $T''_\bullet=T_\bullet$.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}\label{simplicial set connected iff to constant}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set. Then $S_\bullet$ is connected if and only if for every set $X$ the canonical map
\begin{align}\label{simplicial set connected iff to constant-1}
X\cong\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Delta^0,\uline{X}_\bullet)\to\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(S_\bullet,\uline{X}_\bullet).
\end{align}
is bijective.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
One direction is clear from \cref{simplicial set connected image is connected} and \cref{simplicial set constant pi_0 char}. Conversely, suppose that (\ref{simplicial set connected iff to constant-1}) is bijective. Then by considering $X=\emp$, we conclude that there are no maps from $S_\bullet$ to the empty simplicial set, so that $S_\bullet$ is nonempty. If $S_\bullet$ is a disjoint union of simplicial subsets $S'_\bullet\amalg S'_\bullet$, then we obtain a map of simplicial sets
\[S_\bullet\cong S'_\bullet\amalg S''_\bullet\to\Delta^0\amalg\Delta^0\]
and the bijectivity of (\ref{simplicial set connected iff to constant-1}) guarantees that this map factors through one of the summands on the right hand side; it follows that either $S'_\bullet$ or $S''_\bullet$ is empty.
\end{proof}
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set disjoint union of connected component}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set. Then $S_\bullet$ is a disjoint union of its connected components.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
It is clear that different connected components of $S_\bullet$ are disjoint. Let $\sigma$ be an $n$-simplex of $S_\bullet$. We want to show that there exists a unique connected component of $S_\bullet$ which contains $\sigma$. This follows from \cref{simplicial set connected image is connected} applied to the map $\Delta^n\to S_\bullet$ classified by $\sigma$ (note that the standard $n$-simplex $\Delta^n$ is connected).
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}\label{simplicial set connected iff pi_0 singleton}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set. Then $S_\bullet$ is empty if and only if $\pi_0(S_\bullet)$ is empty, and is connected if and only if $\pi_0(S_\bullet)$ has exactly one element.
\end{corollary}
\begin{remark}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set and $S'_\bullet\sub S_\bullet$ be a simplicial subset. If $S'_\bullet$ is a summand of $S_\bullet$, then it is clear from definition that any connected component $S''_\bullet$ of $S_\bullet$ intersecting $S'_\bullet$ must be contained in $S'_\bullet$ (otherwise $S'_\bullet\cap S''_\bullet$ is a nontrivial summand of $S''_\bullet$). Therefore $S'_\bullet$ is a disjoint union of connected components of $S'_\bullet$. Conversely, a disjoint union of connected components is clearly a summand of $S_\bullet$, so we obtain a canonical bijection between subsets of $\pi_0(S_\bullet)$ and summands of $S_\bullet$.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
Let $f:S_\bullet\to T_\bullet$ be a map of simplicial sets. It follows from \cref{simplicial set connected image is connected} that for each connected component $S'_\bullet\sub S_\bullet$, there is a unique connected component $T'_\bullet\sub T_\bullet$ such that $f(S'_\bullet)\sub T'_\bullet$. The map $S'_\bullet\mapsto T'_\bullet$ then determines a map of sets $\pi_0(f):\pi_0(S_\bullet)\to\pi_0(T_\bullet)$. This map is compatible
with composition, and therefore allows us to view $S_\bullet\to \pi_0(S_\bullet)$ as a functor $\pi_0:\mathbf{Set}_\Delta\to\mathbf{Set}$ from the category of simplicial sets to the category of sets.
\end{remark}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set. For every $n$-simplex $\sigma$ of $S_\bullet$, \cref{simplicial set connected image is connected} implies that there is a unique connected component $S'_\bullet\sub S_\bullet$ which contains $\sigma$. The map $\sigma\mapsto S'_\bullet$ then determines a map of simplicial sets
\[u:S_\bullet\to\uline{\pi_0(S_\bullet)}_\bullet\]
where $\uline{\pi_0(S_\bullet)}_\bullet$ denotes the constant simplicial set associated to $\pi_0(S_\bullet)$. The map $u$ is called the \textbf{component map} of $S_\bullet$.
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set component map prop}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set and $u:S_\bullet\to\uline{\pi_0(S_\bullet)}_\bullet$ be the component map of $S_\bullet$. Then for every set $X$, composition with $u$ induces a bijection
\[\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}}(\pi_0(S_\bullet),X)\to\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(S_\bullet,\uline{X}_\bullet).\]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
By decomposing $S_\bullet$ as the union of its connected components, we may assume that $S_\bullet$ is connected, and the desired result is then a reformulation of \cref{simplicial set connected iff to constant}.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}\label{simplicial set pi_0 is left adjoint to constant}
The connected component functor $\pi_0$ is left adjoint to the constant simplicial set functor $X\mapsto\uline{X}_\bullet$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set pi_0 is coequalizer of d_0,d_1}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set and $u:S_\bullet\to\uline{\pi_0(S_\bullet)}_\bullet$ be the component map. Then $u$ exhibits $\pi_0(S_\bullet)$ as the colimit of the diagram $\Delta^{\op}\to\mathbf{Set}$ given by $S_\bullet$. In fact, if $u_0:S_0\to \pi_0(S_\bullet)$ is the map given by the component map of $S_\bullet$, then $u_0$ exhibits $\pi_0(S_\bullet)$ as the coequalizer of the face maps $d_0,d_1:S_1\to S_0$:
\[\begin{tikzcd}
S_1\ar[r,shift left=2pt,"d_0"]\ar[r,shift right=2pt,swap,"d_1"]&S_0\ar[r,"u_0"]&\pi_0(S_\bullet).
\end{tikzcd}\]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The first assertion follows from the fact that $\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(S_\bullet,\uline{X}_\bullet)$ is the set of maps from $S_n\to X$ satisfying compatibilities. In order to prove the second one, let $I$ be a set and $f:S_0\to X$ be a function satisfying $f\circ d_0=f\circ d_1$. Let $\sigma$ be an $n$-simpliex of $S_\bullet$, which we consider as a map $\sigma:\Delta^n\to S_\bullet$. For $0\leq i\leq n$, we may consider $\sigma(i)$ as a vertex of $S_\bullet$. Now if $0\leq i\leq j\leq n$, we then have $f(\sigma(i))=f(\sigma(j))$: we may assume that $i=0$ and $j=n=1$, and then this follows from the hypothesis $f\circ d_0=f\circ d_1$. Then there is a unique element $F(\sigma)\in I$ such that $F(\sigma)=f(\sigma(i))$ for each $0\leq i\leq n$. The map $\sigma\mapsto F(\sigma)$ then defines a map of simplicial sets $S_\bullet\to\uline{X}_\bullet$ which coincides with $f$ at degree zerom, and by \cref{simplicial set component map prop}, we conclude that $f$ factors through $u_0$.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}\label{simplicial set pi_0 is quotient of d_0,d_1 relation}
\cref{simplicial set pi_0 is coequalizer of d_0,d_1} allows us to identify $\pi_0(S_\bullet)$ with the quotient of $S_0/\sim$, where $\sim$ is the equivalence relation generated by the set of edges of $S_\bullet$ (that is, the smallest equivalence relation with the property that $d_0(e)\sim d_1(e)$ for every edge $e\in S_1$). In particular, the set $\pi_0(S_\bullet)$ depends only on the $1$-skeleton of $S_\bullet$.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}\label{simplicial set pi_0 is equivalent class of vertex}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set. Then the set of connected components $\pi_0(S_\bullet)$ can also be described as the coequalizer of the pair of maps $d_0,d_1:S_1^{\circ}\to S_0$, where $S_1^{\circ}$ denotes the set of nondegenerate edges of $S_\bullet$ (since every degenerate edge $e\in S_1$ automatically satisfies $d_0(e)=d_1(e)$). We therefore have a coequalizer diagram of sets
\[\begin{tikzcd}
E(G)\ar[r,shift left=2pt,"d_0"]\ar[r,shift right=2pt,swap,"d_1"]&V(G)\ar[r,"u_0"]&\pi_0(S_\bullet).
\end{tikzcd}\]
where $G=\Gamma(S_\bullet)$ is the directed graph of $S_\bullet$. In other words, we can identify $\pi_0(S_\bullet)$ with the set of connected components of $G$, in the usual graph-theoretic sense. 
\end{remark}
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set connected closed under product}
The collection of connected simplicial sets is closed under finite products.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Since the final object $\Delta^0$ is connected, it suffices to show that the collection of connected simplicial sets is closed under pairwise products. Let $S_\bullet$ and $T_\bullet$ be connected simplicial sets; we wish to show that $S_\bullet\times T_\bullet$ is connected. Equivalently, we want to show that $\pi_0(S_\bullet\times T_\bullet)$ consists of a single element (\cref{simplicial set connected iff pi_0 singleton}). By \cref{simplicial set pi_0 is coequalizer of d_0,d_1}, the component map gives a surjection
\[u_0:S_0\times T_0\twoheadrightarrow \pi_0(S_\bullet\times T_\bullet)\]
It will therefore suffice to show that every pair of vertices $(s,t),(s',t')\in S_0\times T_0$ belong to the same connected component of $S_\bullet\times T_\bullet$. Let $K_\bullet\sub S_\bullet\times T_\bullet$ be the connected component which contains the vertex $(s',t)$. Since $S_\bullet$ is connected, the map
\[S_\bullet\cong S_\bullet\times\{t\}\hookrightarrow S_\bullet\times T_\bullet\]
factors through a unique connected component of $S_\bullet\times T_\bullet$, which must be equal to $K_\bullet$. It follows that $K_\bullet$ contains the vertex $(s,t)$. A similar argument (with the roles of $S_\bullet$ and $T_\bullet$ reversed) also shows that $K_\bullet$ contains $(s',t')$.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}\label{simplicial set pi_0 preserves finite product}
The functor $\pi_0:\mathbf{Set}_\Delta\to\mathbf{Set}$ preserves finite products.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Since $\pi_0(\Delta^0)$ is a singleton, it suffices to show that for every pair of simplicial sets $S_\bullet$ and $T_\bullet$, the canonical map
\[\pi_0(S_\bullet\times T_\bullet)\to\pi_0(S_\bullet)\times \pi_0(T_\bullet)\]
is bijective. Writing $S_\bullet$ and $T_\bullet$ as a disjoint union of connected components (\cref{simplicial set disjoint union of connected component}), we can reduce to the case where $S_\bullet$ and $T_\bullet$ are connected, in which case the desired result follows from \cref{simplicial set connected closed under product}.
\end{proof}
\begin{example}
The collection of connected simplicial sets is not closed under infinite products (so the functor $\pi_0:\mathbf{Set}_\Delta\to\mathbf{Set}$ does not commute with infinite products). For example, let $G$ be the directed graph with vertex set $V(G)=E(G)=\N$, with source and target maps
\[s,t:E(G)\to V(G),\quad s(n)=n,t(n)=n+1.\]
More informally, $G$ is the directed graph depicted in the diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
0\ar[r]&1\ar[r]&2\ar[r]&3\ar[r]&\cdots
\end{tikzcd}\]
The associated $1$-dimensional simplicial set $G_\bullet$ is connected. However, the infinite product $S_\bullet=\prod_{n\in\N}G_\bullet$ is not connected. By definition, the vertices of $S_\bullet$ can be identified with functions $f:\N\to\N$. It is not difficult to see that two such functions $f,g$ belong to the same connected component of $S_\bullet$ if and only if the function $|f-g|$ is bounded. In particular, the identity function $1$ and the zero function $0$ do not belong to the same connected component of $S_\bullet$.
\end{example}
\subsection{Singular simplicial sets and geometric realizations}
Let $X$ be a topological space. We define a simplicial set $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item To each object $[n]\in\Delta^{\op}$, we let $\Sing_n(X)=\Hom_{\mathbf{Top}}(|\Delta^n|,X)$ be the set of singular $n$-simplicies of $X$.
\item To each non-decreasing map $\alpha:[m]\to[n]$, we let $\Sing_\bullet(\alpha):\Sing_n(X)\to\Sing_m(X)$ be the map given by composing with the continuous map
\[|\Delta^m|\to|\Delta^n|,\quad (t_0,\dots,t_m)\mapsto\Big(\sum_{\alpha(i)=0}t_i,\sum_{\alpha(i)=1}t_i,\dots,\sum_{\alpha(i)=n}t_i\Big).\]
\end{itemize}
In particular, by definition the vertices of $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ can be identified with points of $X$, and the edges of $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ can be identified with continuous paths $p:[0,1]\to X$. The simplicial set $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ is called the \textbf{singular simplicial} set of $X$, and we consider $X\mapsto\Sing_\bullet(X)$ as a functor $\Sing_\bullet:\mathbf{Top}\to\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$ from the category of topological spaces to the category of simplicial sets.
\begin{remark}
The functor $X\mapsto\Sing_\bullet(X)$ carries limits in the category of topological spaces to limits in the category of simplicial sets (in fact, the functor $\Sing_\bullet$ admits a left adjoint). It does not preserve colimits in general. However, it does carry coproducts of topological spaces to coproducts of simplicial sets: this follows from the observation that the topological $n$-simplex $|\Delta^n|$ is connected for every $n\geq 0$.
\end{remark}
Let $X$ be a topological space. We denote by $\pi_0(X)$ the set of path components of $X$: that is, the quotient of $X$ by the equivalence relation
\[(x\sim y)\Leftrightarrow(\exists p:[0,1]\to X)[p(0)=x,p(1)=y].\]
Then it follows from \cref{simplicial set pi_0 is equivalent class of vertex} that we have a canonical bijection $\pi_0(\Sing_\bullet(X))\cong\pi_0(X)$. That is, we can identify connected components of the simplicial set $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ with path components of the topological space $X$. In particular, the simplicial set $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ is connected if and only if $X$ is path connected. Since there exist topological spaces $X$ which are connected but not path connected, we see $X$ can be connnected without the singular simplicial set $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ being connected.\par
It will be convenient to consider a generalization $\Sing_\bullet$. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be any category and let $Q^\bullet$ be a cosimplicial object of $\mathcal{C}$, which we view as a covariant functor $Q:\Delta\to\mathcal{C}$. For every object $X\in\mathcal{C}$, the construction $\Delta\ni[n]\mapsto\Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(Q([n]),X)$ determines a functor from $\Delta^{\op}$ to $\mathbf{Set}$, which we can view as a simplicial set. We will denote this simplicial set by $\Sing_\bullet^Q(X)$, so that we have canonical bijections $\Sing_n^Q(X)\cong\Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(Q^n,X)$. The map $X\mapsto\Sing_\bullet^Q(X)$ then gives a functor from the category $\mathcal{C}$ to the category of simplicial sets, which we denote by $\Sing_\bullet^Q:\mathcal{C}\to\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$.\par
\begin{example}
The construction $[n]\mapsto|\Delta^n|$ determines a covariant functor from the simplex category $\Delta$ to the category $\mathbf{Top}$ of topological spaces, which assigns to each morphism $\alpha:[m]\to[n]$ the continuous map
\[|\Delta^m|\to|\Delta^n|,\quad (t_0,\dots,t_m)\mapsto\Big(\sum_{\alpha(i)=0}t_i,\sum_{\alpha(i)=1}t_i,\dots,\sum_{\alpha(i)=n}t_i\Big).\]
We then obtain a cosimplicial topological space, which we denote by $|\Delta^\bullet|$. The corresponding functor $\Sing_\bullet^{|\Delta|}:\mathbf{Top}\to\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$ is just the singular simplicial set functor $\Sing_\bullet$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
The map $[n]\mapsto\Delta^n$ determines a functor from the simplex category $\Delta$ to the category $\mathbf{Set}_\Delta=\Fun(\Delta^{\op},\mathbf{Set})$ of simplicial sets (this is the Yoneda embedding for the simplex category $\Delta$). We can consider this functor as a cosimplicial object in $\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$, which we denote by $\Delta^\bullet$. Then we obtain a functor $\Sing_\bullet^{\Delta}$ from the category of simplicial sets to itself, which is canonically isomorphic to the identity functor $1_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}$, in view of the Yoneda's lemma.
\end{example}
Let $X$  be a topological space. By definition, the $n$-simplices of the simplicial set $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ are continuous maps $|\Delta^n|\to X$, so we have a bijection
\[\Hom_{\mathbf{Top}}(|\Delta^n|,X)\cong\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Delta^n,\Sing_\bullet(X)).\]
We now consider a generalization of this construction, which can be applied to simplicial sets other than $\Delta^n$. Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set and let $Y$ be a topological space. We say that a map of simplicial sets $u:S_\bullet\to\Sing_\bullet(Y)$ exhibits $Y$ as a \textbf{geometric realization} of $S_\bullet$ if, for every topological space $X$, the composite map
\[\Hom_{\mathbf{Top}}(Y,X)\to\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Sing_\bullet(Y),\Sing_\bullet(X))\stackrel{\circ u}{\to}\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(S_\bullet,\Sing_\bullet(X))\]
is bijective. For example, for each $n\geq 0$ the identity map $\id:|\Delta^n|\to|\Delta^n|$ determines an $n$-simplex of the simplical set $\Sing_\bullet(|\Delta^n|)$, which can be identified as a map of simplicial sets $\Delta^n\to\Sing_\bullet(|\Delta^n|)$ exhibiting $|\Delta^n|$ as a geometric realization of $\Delta^n$.\par
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set. It follows immediately from the definitions that if there exists a map $u:S_\bullet\to\Sing_\bullet(Y)$ which exhibits $Y$ as a geometric realization of $S_\bullet$, then the topological space $Y$ is determined up to homeomorphism and depends functorially on $S_\bullet$. We will emphasize this dependence by writing $|S_\bullet|$ to denote a geometric realization of $S_\bullet$. Later we will see that every simplicial set $S_\bullet$ admits a geometric realization.
\begin{lemma}\label{simplicial set limit geometric realization}
Let $\mathcal{J}$ be a small category equipped with a functor $F:\mathcal{J}\to\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$ given by $J\mapsto F(J)_\bullet$ and $S_\bullet=\rlim_{j\in\mathcal{J}} F(J)_\bullet$ be the colimit of $F$. If each of the simplicial sets $F(J)_\bullet$ admits a geometric realization $|F(J)_\bullet|$, then $S_\bullet$ admits a realization, given by the colimit $Y=\rlim_{J\in\mathcal{J}}|F(J)_\bullet|$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
For each $J\in\mathcal{J}$, let $u_J:F(J)_\bullet\to\Sing_\bullet(|F(J)|_\bullet)$ be a map which exhibits $|F(J)_\bullet|$ as a geometric realization of $F(J)_\bullet$. We can then amalgamate the composite maps
\[\begin{tikzcd}
F(J)_\bullet\ar[r,"u_J"]&\Sing_\bullet(|F(J)|_\bullet)\ar[r]&\Sing_\bullet(Y)
\end{tikzcd}\]
to a single map of simplicial sets $u:S_\bullet\to\Sing_\bullet(Y)$. Let $X$ be any topological space; we wish to show that the composite map
\[\Hom_{\mathbf{Top}}(Y,X)\to \Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Sing_\bullet(Y),\Sing_\bullet(X))\stackrel{\circ u}{\to}\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(S_\bullet,\Sing_\bullet(X))\]
is bijective. This is clear, since this composite map can be written as an inverse limit of the bijections $\Hom_{\mathbf{Top}}(|F(J)_\bullet|,X)\cong\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(F(J)_\bullet,\Sing_\bullet(X))$ determined by the $u_J$.
\end{proof}
It is now possible to deduce the existence of geometric realizations in a completely formal way from \cref{simplicial set limit geometric realization}, since every simplicial set can be presented as a colimit of simplices. However, we will instead give a less direct argument which yields some additional information about the structure of the topological spaces $|S_\bullet|$. We begin by studying simplicial subsets of the standard simplex $\Delta^n$.\par
Let $n\geq 0$ be an integer and let $\mathcal{U}$ be a collection of nonempty subsets of $[n]$. We will say that $\mathcal{U}$ is downward closed if $\emp\neq I\sub J\in\mathcal{U}$ implies that $I\in\mathcal{U}$. If this condition is satisfied, we denote by $\Delta^n_{\mathcal{U}}$ denote the simplicial subset of $\Delta^n$ whose $m$-simplices are nondecreasing maps $\alpha:[m]\to[n]$ for which the image of $\alpha$ is an element of $\mathcal{U}$. Similarly, we set
\[|\Delta^n|_{\mathcal{U}}=\{(t_0,\dots,t_n)\in|\Delta^n|:\{i\in[n]:t_i\neq 0\}\in\mathcal{U}\}.\]
\begin{example}\label{simplicial set boundary horn given downward set}
For each $n\geq 0$, the boundary $\partial\Delta^n$ is given by $\Delta^n_\mathcal{U}$ where $\mathcal{U}$ is the collection of all nonempty proper subsets of $[n]$. Similarly, for each $0\leq i\leq n$ the horn $\Lambda^n_i$ is given by $\Delta^n_\mathcal{U}$ where $\mathcal{U}$ is the (uniquely determined) downward closed collection of nonempty subsets $I$ of $[n]$ such that $I\cup\{i\}\neq[n]$. In fact, if $S_\bullet\sub\Delta^n$, then there exists a unique downward closed collection $\mathcal{U}$ of nonempty subsets of $[n]$ such that $S_\bullet=\Delta^n_\mathcal{U}$: just take $\mathcal{U}$ to be the image of all simplicies $\sigma:\Delta^k\to S_\bullet$.
\end{example}
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set Delta^n_U geometric realization}
Let $n$ be a nonnegative integer and let $\mathcal{U}$ be a downward closed collection of nonempty subsets of $[n]$. Then the canonical map $\Delta^n\to\Sing_\bullet(|\Delta^n|)$ restricts to a map of simplicial sets $f_\mathcal{U}:\Sing_\bullet(|\Delta^n|_{\mathcal{U}})$, which exhibits the topological space $|\Delta^n|_{\mathcal{U}}$ as a geometric realization of $\Delta^n_\mathcal{U}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
We proceed by induction on the cardinality of $\mathcal{U}$. If $\mathcal{U}$ is empty, then the simplicial set $\Delta^n_\mathcal{U}$ and the topological space $|\Delta^n|_\mathcal{U}$ are both empty, in which case there is nothing to prove. We may therefore assume that $\mathcal{U}$ is nonempty. Choose some $I\in\mathcal{U}$ whose cardinality is as large as possible, and set
\[\mathcal{U}_0=\mathcal{U}\setminus\{I\},\quad \mathcal{U}_1=\{J\sub I:J\neq\emp\},\quad \mathcal{U}_{0,1}=\mathcal{U}_{0}\cap\mathcal{U}_1.\]
Our inductive hypothesis implies that the maps $f_{\mathcal{U}_0}$ and $f_{\mathcal{U}_{01}}$ exhibit $|\Delta^n|_{\mathcal{U}_0}$ and $|\Delta^n|_{\mathcal{U}_{01}}$ as geometric realizations of $\Delta^n_{\mathcal{U}_0}$ and $\Delta^n_{\mathcal{U}_{01}}$, respectively. Moreover, if $I=\{i_0<i_1<\cdots<i_k\}\sub[n]$, then we can identify $f_{\mathcal{U}_1}$ with the tautological map $\Delta^k\to\Sing_\bullet(|\Delta^k|)$, so that $f_{\mathcal{U}_1}$ exhibits $|\Delta^n|_{\mathcal{U}_1}$ as a geometric realization of $\Delta^n_{\mathcal{U}_1}$. Now, it follows immediately from the definitions that the diagram of simplicial sets
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\Delta^n_{\mathcal{U}_{01}}\ar[r]\ar[d]&\Delta^n_{\mathcal{U}_0}\ar[d]\\
\Delta^n_{\mathcal{U}_1}\ar[r]&\Delta^n_{\mathcal{U}}
\end{tikzcd}\]
is a pushout square, so by \cref{simplicial set limit geometric realization} we are reduced to proving that the diagram of topological spaces
\[\begin{tikzcd}
{|\Delta^n|}_{\mathcal{U}_{01}}\ar[r]\ar[d]&{|\Delta^n|}_{\mathcal{U}_0}\ar[d]\\
{|\Delta^n|}_{\mathcal{U}_1}\ar[r]&{|\Delta^n|}_{\mathcal{U}}
\end{tikzcd}\]
is also a pushout square. This is clear, since $|\Delta^n|_{\mathcal{U}_0}$ and $|\Delta^n|_{\mathcal{U}_1}$ are closed subsets of $|\Delta^n|$ whose union is $|\Delta^n|_{\mathcal{U}}$ and whose intersection is $|\Delta^n|_{\mathcal{U}_{01}}$.
\end{proof}
\begin{example}\label{simplicial set boundary horn geometric realization}
Let $n$ be a nonnegative integer. Combining \cref{simplicial set boundary horn given downward set} with \cref{simplicial set Delta^n_U geometric realization}, we see that the inclusion map $\partial\Delta^n\hookrightarrow\Delta^n$ induces a homeomorphism from $|\partial\Delta^n|$ to the boundary of the topological $n$-simplex $|\Delta^n|$, given by
\[\{(t_0,\dots,t_n)\in|\Delta^n|:\text{$t_i=0$ for some $i$}\}.\]
Similarly, for $0\leq i\leq n$, the inclusion map $\Lambda^n_i\hookrightarrow\Delta^n$ induces a homeomorphism from $|\Lambda^n_i|$ to the subset of $|\Delta^n|$ given by
\[\{(t_0,\dots,t_n)\in\Delta^n:\text{$t_j=0$ for some $j\neq i$}\}.\]
\end{example}
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set geometric realization exist}
For every simplicial set $S_\bullet$, there exists a topological space $Y$ and a map $u:S_\bullet\to\Sing_\bullet(Y)$ which exhibits $Y$ as a geometric realization of $S_\bullet$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set. We first show that for each $k\geq -1$, the skeleton $\sk_k(S_\bullet)$ admits a geometric realization. The proof proceeds by induction on $k$, the case $k=-1$ being trivial (since $\sk_{-1}(S_\bullet)$ is empty). Let $S_k^{\circ}$ denote the collection of nondegenerate $n$-simplices of $S_\bullet$. we note that \cref{simplicial set skeleton pushout square} provides a pushout diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\coprod_{\sigma\in S_k^{\circ}}\partial\Delta^k\ar[d]\ar[r]&\coprod_{\sigma\in S^\circ_k}\Delta^k\ar[d]\\
\sk_{k-1}(S_\bullet)\ar[r]&\sk_k(S_\bullet)
\end{tikzcd}\]
Combining our inductive hypothesis, \cref{simplicial set boundary horn geometric realization} and \cref{simplicial set limit geometric realization}, we see that $\sk_k(S_\bullet)$ admits a geometric realization $|\sk_k(S_\bullet)|$ which fits into a pushout diagram of topological spaces
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\coprod_{\sigma\in S_k^{\circ}}{|\partial\Delta^k|}\ar[r]\ar[d]&\coprod_{\sigma\in S^\circ_k}{|\Delta^k|}\ar[d]\\
{|\sk_{k-1}(S_\bullet)|}\ar[r]&{|\sk_k(S_\bullet)|}
\end{tikzcd}\]
Since $S_\bullet=\bigcup_k\sk_k(S_\bullet)$, the simplicial set $S_\bullet$ also admits a geometric realization, given by the direct limit $\rlim_k|\sk_k(S_\bullet)|$.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
The proof of \cref{simplicial set geometric realization exist} shows that the geometric realization $|S_\bullet|$ of a simplicial set $S_\bullet$ has a canonical realization as a CW complex, having one cell of dimension $n$ for each nondegenerate $n$-simplex $\sigma$ of $S_\bullet$; this cell can be described explicitly as the image of the map
\[|\Delta^n|\setminus|\partial\Delta^n|\hookrightarrow|\Delta^n|\stackrel{\sigma}{\to}|S_\bullet|.\]
\end{remark}
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set full subcategory nonproper if}
Let $\mathcal{U}$ be a full subcategory of the category $\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$ of simplicial sets. Suppose that $\mathcal{U}$ satisfies the following three conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Suppose we are given a pushout diagram of simplicial sets
\[\begin{tikzcd}
X_\bullet\ar[r,"f"]\ar[d]&Y_\bullet\ar[d]\\
X'_\bullet\ar[r]&Y'_\bullet
\end{tikzcd}\]
where $f$ is a monomorphism. If $X_\bullet$, $Y_\bullet$, and $X'_\bullet$ belong to $\mathcal{U}$, then $Y_\bullet$ belongs to $\mathcal{U}$.
\item[(b)] Suppose we are given a sequence of monomorphisms of simplicial sets
\[\begin{tikzcd}
X^{(0)}_\bullet\ar[r,hook]&X^{(1)}_\bullet\ar[r,hook]&X^{(2)}_\bullet\ar[r]&\cdots
\end{tikzcd}\]
If each $X^{(m)}_\bullet$ belongs to $\mathcal{U}$, then the sequentual colimit $\rlim_mX{(m)}_\bullet$ belongs to $\mathcal{U}$.
\item[(c)] For each $n\geq 0$ and every set $I$, the coproduct $\coprod_{i\in I}\Delta^n$ belongs to $\mathcal{U}$.
\end{itemize}
Then every simplicial set belongs to the category $\mathcal{U}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Set $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set; we want to show that $S_\bullet$ belongs to $\mathcal{U}$. Since $S_\bullet=\bigcup_k\sk_k(S_\bullet)$, we can identify $S_\bullet$ with the colimit $\rlim_k\sk_k(S_\bullet)$. By condition (b), it will suffice to show that each skeleton $\sk_k(S_\bullet)$ belongs to $\mathcal{U}$. We may therefore assume without loss of generality that $S_\bullet$ has dimension $\leq k$, for some integer $n$, and we proceed by induction on $k$. In the case $k=-1$, the simplicial set $S_\bullet$ is empty, and the desired result is a special case of (c). To carry out the inductive step, we invoke \cref{simplicial set skeleton pushout square} to choose a pushout diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\coprod_{\sigma\in S_k^{\circ}}\partial\Delta^k\ar[d]\ar[r]&\coprod_{\sigma\in S^\circ_k}\Delta^k\ar[d]\\
\sk_{k-1}(S_\bullet)\ar[r]&\sk_k(S_\bullet)
\end{tikzcd}\]
By condition (a), it will suffice to show that the simplicial sets $\sk_{n-1}(S_\bullet)$, $\coprod_{\sigma\in S_k^{\circ}}\partial\Delta^k$, and $\coprod_{\sigma\in S_k^{\circ}}\Delta^k$ belong to $\mathcal{U}$. In the first two cases, this follows from our inductive hypothesis, and the third follows from assumption (c).
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}\label{simplicial set subcategory small colimits and Delta^n nonproper}
Let $\mathcal{U}$ be a full subcategory of the category $\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$ of simplicial sets. If $\mathcal{U}$ is closed under small colimits and contains the standard $n$-simplex $\Delta^n$ for each $n\leq 0$, then $\mathcal{U}=\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
If $\mathcal{U}$ is closed under small colimits and contains $\Delta^n$, then it satisfies conditions of \cref{simplicial set full subcategory nonproper if}.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
We can state \cref{simplicial set subcategory small colimits and Delta^n nonproper} more informally as follows: the category $\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$ of simplicial sets is generated, under small colimits, by objects of the form $\Delta^n$. In fact, one can say more: it is freely generated (under small colimits) by the essential image of the Yoneda embedding
\[\Delta\hookrightarrow\mathbf{Set}_\Delta,\quad [n]\mapsto\Delta^n.\]
In fact, this is a general fact about presheaf categories.
\end{remark}
We now sketch another proof of \cref{simplicial set subcategory small colimits and Delta^n nonproper}, which illustrates some ideas which will be useful later. Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set, we define a category $\Delta_S$ as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item The objects of $\Delta_S$ are pairs $([n],\sigma)$, where $[n]$ is an object of $\Delta$ and $\sigma$ is an $n$-simplex.
\item A morphism from $([n],\sigma)$ to $([m],\tau)$ in the category $\Delta_S$ is a nondecreasing function $f:[n]\to[m]$ with the property that the induced map $S_m\to S_n$ sends $\tau$ to $\sigma$.
\end{itemize}
The category $\Delta_S$ is called the \textbf{category of simplicies of $\bm{S_\bullet}$}. Via the Yoneda embedding $\Delta\hookrightarrow\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$, we can identify $\Delta_S$ with the category whose objects are simplicial sets of the form $\Delta^n$ (for some $n\neq 0$), which are equipped with a map of simplicial sets $\Delta^n\to S_\bullet$. In particular, we have a canonical map of simplicial sets $\varinjlim_{([n],\sigma)}\Delta^n\to S_\bullet$. To prove \cref{simplicial set subcategory small colimits and Delta^n nonproper}, it suffices to observe that this map is an isomorphism.\par
Now as a generalization of \cref{simplicial set geometric realization exist}, we prove the following theorem about the adjointness of $\Sing_\bullet$ functors.
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set Sing^Q functor adjoint}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category, let $Q^\bullet$ be a cosimplicial object of $\mathcal{C}$, and let $\Sing_\bullet^Q:\mathcal{C}\to\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$ be the corresponding functor. If the category $\mathcal{C}$ admits small colimits, then the functor $\Sing_\bullet^Q$ admits a left adjoint $\mathbf{Set}_\Delta\to\mathcal{C}$, which is denoted by $S_\bullet\to|S_\bullet|^Q$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
We say a simplicial set $S_\bullet$ is good if the functor
\[\mathcal{C}\ni C\mapsto\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(S_\bullet,\Sing_\bullet^Q(C))\]
is corepresentable by an object of the category $C$ (in which case we denote the corepresenting object by $|S_\bullet|^Q$). It follows from Yoneda's lemma that the standard $n$-simplex $\Delta^n$ is good for each $n\geq 0$, with $|\Delta^n|^Q=Q^n$. If $\mathcal{C}$ admits small colimits, then the proof of \cref{simplicial set limit geometric realization} shows that the collection of good simplicial sets is closed under small colimits. It now suffices to observe that every simplicial set $S_\bullet$ can be written as a small colimit of simplices (\cref{simplicial set subcategory small colimits and Delta^n nonproper}).
\end{proof}
\begin{example}\label{simplicial set pi_0 as geometric realization}
The functor $\pi_0:\mathbf{Set}_\Delta\to\mathbf{Set}$ can be regarded as special case of \cref{simplicial set Sing^Q functor adjoint}. In fact, if $Q^\bullet\to\mathbf{Set}$ is the constant functor whose value is a singleton set $\ast\in\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$, then $\Sing_\bullet^Q$ coincides with the constant simplicial set functor $X\mapsto\uline{X}_\bullet$, so the functor $|-|^Q$ agrees with $\pi_0$ in view of \cref{simplicial set component map prop}.
\end{example}
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set geometric realization connected iff}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set. The following conditions are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(\rmnum{1})] The geometric realization $|S_\bullet|$ is a path-connected topological space.
\item[(\rmnum{2})] The geometric realization $|S_\bullet|$ is a connected topological space.
\item[(\rmnum{3})] The simplicial set $S_\bullet$ is connected.
\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The implication (\rmnum{1})$\Rightarrow$(\rmnum{2}) holds for any topological space. To prove that (\rmnum{2})$\Rightarrow$(\rmnum{3}), we observe that any decomposition $S_\bullet\cong S'_\bullet\amalg S''_\bullet$ into disjoint nonempty simplicial subsets determines a homeomorphism $|S_\bullet|\cong|S'_\bullet|\amalg|S''_\bullet|$. We now complete the proof by showing that (\rmnum{3})$\Rightarrow$(\rmnum{1}). Note that we have a commutative diagram of sets
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\rlim_{\sigma:\Delta^n\to S_\bullet}{|\Delta^n|}\ar[r,"\sim"]\ar[d]&{|S_\bullet|}\ar[d]\\
\rlim_{\sigma:\Delta^n\to S_\bullet}\pi_0(|\Delta^n|)\ar[r]&\pi_0(|S_\bullet|)
\end{tikzcd}\]
where the upper horizontal map is bijective and the right vertical map is surjective. It follows that the lower horizontal map is also surjective. Since each of the topological spaces $|\Delta^n|$ is path connected, the colimit in the lower left can be identified with the set $\pi_0(S_\bullet)$ (\cref{simplicial set pi_0 as geometric realization}). If $S_\bullet$ is connected, the set $\pi_0(S_\bullet)$ consists of a single element, so that $\pi_0(|S_\bullet|)$ is also a singleton.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
Recall that we have remarked that there exist topological spaces $X$ which are connected but not path connected, so $X$ can be connnected without the singular simplicial set $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ being connected. However, \cref{simplicial set geometric realization connected iff} shows that the geometric realizations $|S_\bullet|$ rule out such pathological examples. This also suggests that the functor $S_\bullet\mapsto|S_\bullet|$ from $\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$ to $\mathbf{Top}$ is not essentially surjective, since connectedness and path-connectedness are topological properties.
\end{remark}
\begin{corollary}\label{simplicial set pi_0 and geometric realization}
For every simplicial set $S_\bullet$, we have a canonical bijection $\pi_0(S_\bullet)\cong\pi_0(|S_\bullet|)$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Writing $S_\bullet$ as a disjoint union of connected components (\cref{simplicial set disjoint union of connected component}), we can reduce to the case where $S_\bullet$ is connected, in which case both sets have a single element.
\end{proof}
\subsection{Kan complexes}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set, we say that $S_\bullet$ is a \textbf{Kan complex} if it satisfies the following condition:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=40pt]
\item[(Kan)] For any positive integer $n>0$ and $0\leq i\leq n$, any map of simplicial sets $\sigma_0:\Lambda^n_i\to S_\bullet$ can be extended into a map $\sigma:\Delta^n\to S_\bullet$, where $\Lambda^n_i$ is the $i$-th horn.
\end{enumerate}
As we have remarked on the begining of this chapter, such properties hold for simplicial sets of the form $\Sing_\bullet(X)$: in other words, $\Sing_\bullet$ sends $\mathbf{Top}$ to the full subcategory of Kan complexes of $\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$.
\begin{example}\label{simplicial set dim 1 not Kan}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set of dimension exactly $1$ (that is, a simplicial set $S_\bullet$ which arises from a directed graph with at least one edge), then $S_\bullet$ is not a Kan complex. In fact, let $e\in S_1$ be an edge of $S_\bullet$, $d_0(e)=x$, $d_1(e)=y$, and consider the map $\tau_0:\Lambda^2_0\to S_\bullet$ given by $(e,s_0(x),\ast)$, which we describe as a diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
&y\ar[rd,"e"]&\\
x\ar[ru,dashed]\ar[rr,"s_0(x)"]&&x
\end{tikzcd}\]
If $\tau:\Delta^2\to S_\bullet$ is an extension of $\tau_0$, then we claim that $\tau$ is nondegenerate, which contradicts the assumption that $\dim(S_\bullet)=1$. In fact, since $e$ is nondegenerate, any factorization of $\tau$ is of the form
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\Delta^2\ar[r]&\Delta^1\ar[r,"\sigma"]&S_\bullet
\end{tikzcd}\]
where the map $\Delta^2\to\Delta^1$ is given by corresponds to a surjection $\alpha:[2]\to[1]$. If $e'=d_2(\tau)$ is another edge of $\tau$, then we have
\begin{gather*}
x=d_0(e)=d_0(d_0(\tau))=\sigma(\alpha(2)),\quad y=d_1(e)=d_1(d_0(\tau))=\sigma(\alpha(1)),\\
y=d_0(e')=d_0(d_2(\tau))=\sigma(\alpha(1)),\quad x=d_1(e')=d_1(d_2(\tau))=\sigma(\alpha(0)).
\end{gather*}
But this contradicts to the fact that $\alpha$ is a nondecreasing map.
\end{example}
\begin{example}[\textbf{Products of Kan Complexes}]\label{simplicial set product of Kan}
Let $\{S_\bullet^\alpha\}_{\alpha\in I}$ be a collection of simplicial sets parametrized by a set $I$, and $S_\bullet=\prod_{\alpha}S_\bullet^\alpha$ be their product. If each $S_\bullet^\alpha$ is a Kan complex, then $S_\bullet$ is a Kan complex. The converse holds provided that each $S_\bullet^\alpha$ is nonempty.
\end{example}
\begin{example}[\textbf{Coproducts of Kan Complexes}]\label{simplicial set coproduct of Kan}
Let $\{S_\bullet^\alpha\}_{\alpha\in I}$ be a collection of simplicial sets parametrized by a set $I$, and $S_\bullet=\coprod_{\alpha}S_\bullet^\alpha$ be their coproduct. For each $0\leq i\leq n$, the restriction map
\[\theta:\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Delta^n,S_\bullet)\to\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Lambda_i^n,S_\bullet)\]
can be identified with the coproduct (formed in the arrow category $\Fun([1],\mathbf{Set}_\Delta))$ of restriction maps $\theta_\alpha:\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Delta^n,S_\bullet^\alpha)\to\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Lambda^n_i,S_\bullet^\alpha)$ (this follows from the observation that
the simplicial sets $\Delta^n$ and $\Lambda_i^n$ are connected). It follows that $\theta$ is surjective if and only if each $\theta_\alpha$ is surjective. Allowing $n$ and $i$ to vary, we conclude that $S_\bullet$ is a Kan complex if and only if each summand $S_\bullet^\alpha$ is a Kan complex. In particular, if $S_\bullet$ is a simplicial set, then $S_\bullet$ is a Kan complex if and only if each connected component of $S_\bullet$ is a Kan complex.
\end{example}
\begin{example}\label{simplicial set constant is Kan}
Let $S$ be a set and let $\uline{S}_\bullet$ denote the associated constant simplicial set. Then $\uline{S}_\bullet$ is a Kan complex: this follows from the fact that each connected component of $\uline{S}_\bullet$ is isomorphic to $\Delta^0$ and each horn $\Lambda^n_i$ is connected.
\end{example}
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set singular is Kan}
Let $X$ be a topological space. Then the singular simplicial set $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ is a Kan complex.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $\sigma_0:\Lambda_i^n\to\Sing_\bullet(X)$ be a map of simplicial sets for $n>0$. Using the geometric realization functor, we can identify $\sigma_0$ with a continuous map of topological spaces $f_0:|\Lambda^n_i|\to X$; we want to show that $f_0$ factors as a composition
\[\begin{tikzcd}
{|\Lambda^n_i|}\ar[r]&{|\Delta^n|}\ar[r,"f"]&X
\end{tikzcd}\]
Now using \cref{simplicial set boundary horn geometric realization}, $|\Lambda^n_i|$ is identified with the subset
\[\{(t_0,\dots,t_n)\in|\Delta^n:\text{$t_j=0$ for some $j\neq i$}\}\sub|\Delta^n|\]
so we can take $f$ to be the composition $f_0\circ\iota$, where $\iota$ is any continuous retraction of $|\Delta^n|$ onto the subset $|\Lambda^n_i|$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set group is Kan}
Let $G_\bullet$ be a simplicial group (that is, a simplicial object of the category of groups). Then the underlying simplicial set of $G_\bullet$ is a Kan complex.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $n$ be a positive integer and $\sigma:\Lambda^n_i\to G_\bullet$ be a map of simplicial sets for some $0\leq i\leq n$, which we will identify with a tuple $(\sigma_0,\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_{i-1},\ast,\sigma_{i+1},\dots,\sigma_n)$ of elements of the group $G_{n-1}$ (\cref{simplicial set horn description}). We want to show that there exists an element $\tau\in G_n$ such that $d_h\tau=\sigma_j$ for $j\neq i$. Now let $e$ be the identity of $G_{n-1}$; we first treat the special case where $\sigma_{i+1}=\cdots=\sigma_n=e$. If in addition we have $\sigma_0=\cdots=\sigma_{n-1}=e$, then we can take $\tau$ to be the identity element of $G_n$. Otherwise, there exists some smallest integer $j<i$ such that $\sigma_j\neq e$, and we proceed by descending induction on $j$. Let $\eta=s_j(\sigma_j)\in G_n$ and consider the map $\tilde{\sigma}:\Lambda_i^n\to G_n$ given by the tuple $(\tilde{\sigma}_0,\tilde{\sigma}_1,\dots,\tilde{\sigma}_{i-1},\ast,\tilde{\sigma}_{i+1},\dots,\tilde{\sigma}_n)$ where $\tilde{\sigma}_k=\sigma_k(d_k(\eta))^{-1}$. Since $d_j\circ s_j=\id$ (\cref{simplicial set face degeneracy map char}), we have $\tilde{\sigma}_0=\cdots=\tilde{\sigma}_j=e$ and $\tilde{\sigma}_{i+1}=\cdots=\tilde{\sigma}_n=e$, so by invoking our inductive hypothesis we conclude that there exists an element $\tilde{\tau}\in G_n$ satisfying $d_k\tilde{\tau}=\tilde{\sigma}_k$ for $k\neq i$. We can then complete the proof by taking $\tau$ to be the product $\tilde{\tau}\eta$.\par
If not all of the equalities $\sigma_{i+1}=\cdots=\sigma_n=e$ hold, then there exists some largest integer $j>i$ such that $\sigma_j\neq e$, and we proceed by ascending induction on $j$. Let $\eta=s_{j-1}(\sigma_j)$ and $\tilde{\sigma}:\Lambda^n_i\to G_\bullet$ be the map given by the tuple $(\tilde{\sigma}_0,\tilde{\sigma}_1,\dots,\tilde{\sigma}_{i-1},\ast,\tilde{\sigma}_{i+1},\dots,\tilde{\sigma}_n)$ with $\tilde{\sigma}_k=\sigma_k(d_k(\eta))^{-1}$, as above. Then $\tilde{\sigma}_{j}=\cdots=\tilde{\sigma}_n=e$ so the inductive hypothesis guarantees the existence of an element $\tilde{\tau}\in G_n$ such that $d_k(\tilde{\tau})=\tilde{\sigma}_k$ for $k\neq i$. As before, we complete the proof by setting $\tau=\tilde{\tau}\eta$.
\end{proof}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set. According to \cref{simplicial set pi_0 is quotient of d_0,d_1 relation}, we can identify the set of connected components $\pi_0(S_\bullet)$ with the quotient $S_0/\sim$, where $\sim$ is the equivalence relation generated by the image of the map $(d_0,d_1):S_1\to S_0\times S_0$. In the special case where $S_\bullet=\Sing_\bullet(X)$ is the singular simplicial set of a topological space $X$, this description simplifies: the image of the map $(d_0,d_1)$ is already an equivalence relation, and $\pi_0(S_\bullet)$ can be identified with the set of path components $\pi_0(X)$. This observation can be generalized to any Kan complex:
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set Kan same component iff connected by edge}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a Kan complex containing a pair of vertices $x,y\in S_0$. Then $x$ and $y$ belong to the same connected component of $S_\bullet$ if and only if there exists an edge $e\in S_1$ satisfying $d_0(e)=x$ and $d_1(e)=y$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $R$ denote the image of the map $(d_0,d_1):S_1\to S_0\times S_0$. According to \cref{simplicial set pi_0 is quotient of d_0,d_1 relation}, we can identify $\pi_0(S_\bullet)$ with the quotient of $S_0$ by the equivalence relation generated by $R$. It will therefore suffice to show that $R$ is already an equivalence relation on $S_0$. To prove this, we first note that for any $x\in S_0$, the map $(d_0,d_1)$ sends the degenerate edge $s_0(x)$ to the pair $(x,x)\in S_0\times S_0$, so $R$ is reflexive. Now suppose that $(x,y)\in R$, so that there exists an edge $e\in S_1$ with $d_0(e)=x$, $d_1(e)=y$. Then the tuple $(e,s_0(x),\ast)$ gives a map of simplicial sets $\sigma_0:\Lambda^2_2\to S_\bullet$, which we depict as a diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
&y\ar[rd,"e"]&\\
x\ar[ru,dashed]\ar[rr,"s_0(x)"]&&x
\end{tikzcd}\]
Since $S_\bullet$ is a Kan complex, we can complete this diagram to a $2$-simplex $\sigma:\Delta^2\to S_\bullet$. Then $e'=d_2(\sigma)$ is an edge of $S_\bullet$ satisfying $d_0(e')=y$ and $d_1(e')=x$, which proves that the pair $(y,x)$ belongs to $R$, so $R$ is symmetirc\par
Finally, suppose that we are given vertices $x,y,z$ in $S_0$ with $(x,y)\in R$ and $(y,z)\in R$; we want to show that $(x,z)\in R$. Choose edges $e,e'\in S_1$ satisfying $d_0(e)=x$, $d_1(e)=y=d_0(e')$, $d_1(e')=z$. Then the tuple $(e',\ast,e)$ determines a map of simplicial sets $\tau_0:\Lambda^2_1\to S_\bullet$, which we depict as a diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
&y\ar[rd,"e"]&\\
x\ar[ru,"e'"]\ar[rr,dashed]&&x
\end{tikzcd}\]
Our assumption that $S_\bullet$ is a Kan complex guarantees that we can extend $\tau_0$ to a $2$-simplex $\tau:\Delta^2\to S_\bullet$. Then $e''=d_1(\tau)$ is an edge of $S_\bullet$ satisfying $d_0(e'')=x$ and $d_1(e'')=z$, which proves that $(x,z)\in R$. In other words, $R$ is transitive.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}\label{simplicial set Kan product and pi_0}
Let $\{S_\bullet^\alpha\}_{\alpha\in I}$ be a collection of Kan complexes, and $S_\bullet=\prod_\alpha S_\bullet^\alpha$ be their product. Then the canonical map
\[\pi_0(S_\bullet)\to\prod_{\alpha\in I}\pi_0(S_\bullet^\alpha)\]
is bijective. In particular, $S_\bullet$ is connected if and only if each factor $S_\bullet^\alpha$ is connected.
\end{corollary}
\section{Nerves}
In \autoref{simplicial set section}, we introduced the theory of simplicial sets and discussed its relationship to the theory of topological spaces. Every topological space $X$ determines a simplicial set $\Sing_\bullet(X)$, and simplicial sets of the form $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ have a special property: they are Kan complexes. In this section, we will study a different class of simplicial sets, which arise instead from the theory of categories. We will associate to every category $\mathcal{C}$ a simplicial set $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$, called the nerve of $\mathcal{C}$. We will see that the construction $\mathcal{C}\mapsto N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ is fully faithful, and a simplicial set $S_\bullet$ belongs to the essential image of the functor $\mathcal{C}\mapsto N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ if and only if it satisfies a certain lifting condition. This lifting condition is similar to the Kan extension condition, but has a slight difference. Also, we will see that a simplicial set of the form $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ is a Kan complex if and only if every morphism in $\mathcal{C}$ is invertible.
\subsection{Nerve of a category}
For each integer $n\geq 0$, let us view the linearly ordered set $[n]$ as a category (where there is a unique morphism from $i$ to $j$ if and only if $i\leq j$). For any category $\mathcal{C}$, we denote $N_n(\mathcal{C})$ the set of all functors from $[n]$ to $\mathcal{C}$. Note that any nondecreasing map $\alpha:[m]\to [n]$ can be also considered as a functor between two categories, so composition with $\alpha$ determines a map of sets $N_n(\mathcal{C})\to N_m(\mathcal{C})$. We can therefore view the construction $[n]\mapsto N_n(\mathcal{C})$ as a simplicial set, which is denoted by $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ and called the \textbf{nerve} of $\mathcal{C}$. The geometric realization $|N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})|$ is called the \textbf{classifying space} of the category $\mathcal{C}$.\par
For each $n\geq 1$, from the definition of $N_n(\mathcal{C})$ we see that an element of $N_n(\mathcal{C})$ can be identified with a diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
C_0\ar[r,"f_1"]&C_1\ar[r,"f_2"]&\cdots\ar[r,"f_n"]&C_n
\end{tikzcd}\]
in the category $\mathcal{C}$. In other words, the elements of $N_n(\mathcal{C})$ are $n$-tuples $(f_1,\dots,f_n)$ of morphisms of $\mathcal{C}$ having the property that, for $0<i<n$, the source of $f_{i+1}$ coincides with the target of $f_i$.
\begin{example}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category. Then vertices of the simplicial set $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ can be identified with objects of the category $\mathcal{C}$, and edges of $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ can be identified with morphisms in the category $\mathcal{C}$. Let $f:X\to Y$ be a morphism in $\mathcal{C}$, regarded as an edge of the simplicial set $N(\mathcal{C})$. Then the faces of $f$ are given by the target $d_0(f)=Y$ and the source $d_1(f)=X$, respectively. Conversely, if $X$ is an object of $\mathcal{C}$, which we regard as a vertex of the simplicial set $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$, then the degenerate edge $s_0(X)$ is the identity morphism $\id_X:X\to X$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category. For every integer $n\geq 0$, we let $N_{\leq n}(\mathcal{C})$ denote the $n$-skeleton of the simplicial set $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$. In the special case $n=0$, this recovers the discrete simplicial set associated to the set of objects $\Ob(C)$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}[\textbf{Face Operators on \boldmath$N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$}]\label{simplicial set nerve of cat face map char}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category and suppose we are given an $n$-simplex $\sigma$ of the simplicial set $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ for some $n>0$, which we identify with a diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
C_0\ar[r,"f_1"]&C_1\ar[r,"f_2"]&C_2\ar[r]&\cdots\ar[r,"f_n"]&C_n
\end{tikzcd}\]
Then the $0$-th face $d_0(\sigma)\in N_{n-1}(\mathcal{C})$ can be identified with the diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
C_1\ar[r,"f_2"]&C_2\ar[r]&C_3\ar[r]&\cdots\ar[r,"f_n"]&C_n
\end{tikzcd}\]
obtained from $\sigma$ by "deleting" the object $C_0$ (and the morphism $f_1$ with source $C_0$). Similarly, the $n$-th face $d_n(\sigma)\in N_{n-1}(\mathcal{C})$ can be identified with the diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
C_0\ar[r,"f_1"]&C_1\ar[r,"f_2"]&C_2\ar[r]&\cdots\ar[r,"f_{n-1}"]&C_{n-1}
\end{tikzcd}\]
obtained from $\sigma$ by "deleting" the object $C_n$ (and the morphism $f_n$ with target $C_n$). On the other hand, for $0<i<n$, the $i$-th face $d_i(\sigma)\in N_{n-1}(\mathcal{C})$ can be identified with the diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
C_0\ar[r,"f_1"]&C_1\ar[r,"f_2"]&\cdots\ar[r]&C_{i-1}\ar[r,"f_{i+1}\circ f_i"]&C_{i+1}\ar[r]&\cdots\ar[r,"f_n"]&C_n
\end{tikzcd}\]
obtained by "deleting" the object $C_i$ (and composing the morphisms $f_i$ and $f_{i+1}$).
\end{example}
\begin{example}[\textbf{Degeneracy Operators on \boldmath$N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$}]\label{simplicial set nerve of cat degeneracy map char}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category and suppose we are given an $n$-simplex $\sigma$ of the simplicial set $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ which we identify with a diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
C_0\ar[r,"f_1"]&C_1\ar[r,"f_2"]&C_2\ar[r]&\cdots\ar[r,"f_n"]&C_n
\end{tikzcd}\]
Then, for $0\leq i\leq n$, we can identify $s_i(\sigma)\in N_{n+1}(\mathcal{C})$ with the diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
C_0\ar[r,"f_1"]&\cdots\ar[r]&C_{i-1}\ar[r,"f_i"]&C_i\ar[r,"\id_{C_i}"]&C_i\ar[r,"f_{i+1}"]&C_{i+1}\ar[r]&\cdots\ar[r,"f_n"]&C_n
\end{tikzcd}\]
obtained from $\sigma$ by "inserting" the identity morphism $\id_{C_i}$. From this, we also conclude that an $n$-simplex $\sigma$ is degenerate if and only if some $f_i$ is an identity of $\mathcal{C}$ (in which case we must have $C_{i-1}=C_i$).
\end{example}
\begin{example}[\textbf{Nerve of a partially ordered set}]
Let $I$ be a set equipped with a partial ordering $\preceq$. Then we can regard $I$ as a category whose objects are the elements of $I$, with morphisms given by
\[\Hom_I(i,j)=\begin{cases}
\ast&\text{if $i\preceq j$},\\
\emp&\text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}\]
The nerve of this category is denoted by $N_\bullet(I)$, and called the \textbf{nerve of the partially ordered set $I$}. For each $n\geq 0$, we can identify $n$-simplices of $N_\bullet(I)$ with monotone functions $[n]\to I$: that is, with nondecreasing sequences $(i_0,\dots,i_n)$ of elements of $I$. For example, if $n\geq 0$ is an integer, then the nerve $N_\bullet([n])$ can be identified with the standard $n$-simplex $\Delta^n$.
\end{example}
\begin{remark}\label{simplicial set nerve of cat is Sing^Q}
The map $\mathcal{C}\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ determines a functor $N_\bullet:\mathbf{Cat}\to\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$ from the category of (small) categories to the category $\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$ of simplicial sets. This is a special case of the functor $\Sing_\bullet^Q$. More precisely, we can identify $N_\bullet$ with the functor $\Sing_\bullet^Q$, where $Q:\Delta\to\mathbf{Cat}$ is the functor which carries each object $[n]\in\Delta$ to itself, regarded as a category.
\end{remark}
It is an important fact that passing from a category $\mathcal{C}$ to its nerve $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ does not lose any information: one can think that $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ is just obtained by organizing the datum of $\mathcal{C}$ in a very efficient way. Thanks to the following proposition, we often identify a category $\mathcal{C}$ with its nerve $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$.
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set nerve of cat fully faithful}
The nerve functor $N_\bullet:\mathbf{Cat}\to\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$ is fully faithful.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ be categories. We wish to show that the nerve functor $N_\bullet$ induces a bijection
\[\theta:\Hom_{\mathbf{Cat}}(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})\to\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(N_\bullet(\mathcal{C}),N_\bullet(\mathcal{D})).\]
Here the source of $\theta$ is the set of all functors from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{D}$. We first note that $\theta$ is injective: a functor $F:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$ is completely determined by its behavior on the objects and morphisms of $\mathcal{C}$, and therefore by the behavior of $\theta(F)$ on the vertices and edges of the simplicial set $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$. Now let $f:N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{D})$ be a morphism of simplicial sets; we use $f$ to construct a functor $F:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$ such that $\theta(F)=f$. For each $n\geq 0$, the morphism $f$ determines a map of sets $N_n(\mathcal{C})\to N_n(\mathcal{D})$, which is also denoted by $f$. In the case $n=0$, this map sends each object $C\in\mathcal{C}$ to an object of $\mathcal{D}$, which we denote by $F(C)$. For every pair of objects $C,D\in\mathcal{C}$, the map $f$ carries each morphism $u:C\to D$ to a morphism $f(u)$ in the category $\mathcal{D}$. Since $f$ commutes with face maps, the morphism $f(u)$ has source $F(C)$ and target $F(D)$ (see \cref{simplicial set nerve of cat face map char}), and can therefore be regarded as an element of $\Hom_{\mathcal{D}}(F(C),F(D))$; we denote this element by $F(u)$. We then complete the proof by verifying the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] The preceding construction determines a functor $F:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$.
\item[(b)] We have an equality $f=\theta(F)$ of maps from $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ to $N_\bullet(\mathcal{D})$.
\end{itemize}
To prove (a), we first note that the compatibility of $f$ with degeneracy maps implies that we have $F(\id_C)=\id_{F(C)}$ for each $C\in\mathcal{C}$ (see \cref{simplicial set nerve of cat degeneracy map char}). It therefore suffices to show that for every pair of composable morphisms $u:C\to D$ and $v:D\to E$ in the category $\mathcal{C}$, we have $F(v)\circ F(u)=F(v\circ u)$ as elements of the set $\Hom_{\mathcal{D}}(F(C),F(E))$. For this, we observe that the diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
C\ar[r,"u"]&D\ar[r,"v"]&E
\end{tikzcd}\]
can be identified with a $2$-simplex $\sigma$ of $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$. Using the equality $d_i(f(\sigma))=f(d_i(\sigma))$ for $i=0,2$, we see that $f(\sigma)$ corresponds to the diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
F(C)\ar[r,"F(u)"]&F(D)\ar[r,"F(v)"]&F(E)
\end{tikzcd}\]
in $\mathcal{D}$. Since $F(v)\circ F(u)=d_1(f(\sigma))$ and $F(v\circ u)=f(d_1(\sigma))$, condition (a) therefore follows. To prove (b), we must show that $f(\tau)=\theta(F)(\tau)$ for each $n$-simplex $\tau$ of $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$. This follows by construction in the case $n=1$, and follows in general since an $n$-simplex of $N_\bullet(\mathcal{D})$ is determined by its $1$-dimensional faces.
\end{proof}
We now describe the essential image of the functor $N_\bullet:\mathbf{Cat}\to\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$. As we shall see, this is characterized by the following conditions similar to (Kan):
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=40pt]
\item[(Ner)] For any pair of integers $0<i<n$, any map of simplicial sets $\sigma_0:\Lambda_i^n\to S_\bullet$ can be uniquely extended into a map $\sigma:\Delta^n\to S_\bullet$.
\end{enumerate}
The proof of this characterization will require some preliminaries. We begin by establishing the necessity.
\begin{lemma}\label{simplicial set nerve of cat satisfy condition Ner}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category. Then the simplicial set N•(C) satisfies condition (Ner).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Choose integers $0<i<n$ together with a map of simplicial sets $\sigma_0:\Lambda_i^n\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$; we want to show that $\sigma_0$ can be extended uniquely to a $n$-simplex of $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$. For $0\leq j\leq n$, let $C_j\in\mathcal{C}$ denote the image under $\sigma_0$ of the $j$-th vertex of $\Delta^n$ (which belongs to the horn $\Lambda^n_i$). We first consider the case where $n\geq 3$. In this case, $\Lambda^n_i$ contains every edge of $\Delta^n$. For $0\leq j\leq k\leq n$, let $f_{kj}:C_j\to C_k$ denote the $1$-simplex of $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ obtained by evaluating $\sigma_0$ on the edge of $\Delta^n$ corresponding to the pair $(j,k)$. We claim that the map $j\mapsto C_j,(j\leq k)\mapsto f_{kj}$ determines a functor $[n]\to\mathcal{C}$, which can be identified with an $n$-simplex of $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ having the desired properties. It is easy to see that $f_{jj}=\id_{C_j}$ for each $0\leq j\leq n$, so we only need to show that $f_{lk}\circ f_{kj}=f_{lj}$ for every triple $0\leq j\leq k\leq l\leq n$. Such a triple determines a $2$-simplex $\tau$ of $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$. If $\tau$ is contained in $\Lambda^n_i$, then $\tilde{\tau}=\sigma_0(\tau)$ is a $2$-simplex of $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ satisfying
\[d_0(\tilde{\tau})=f_{lk},\quad d_1(\tilde{\tau})=f_{lj},\quad d_2(\tilde{\tau})=f_{kj},\]
so that $\tilde{\tau}$ "witnesses" the identity $f_{lk}\circ f_{kj}=f_{lj}$ (c.f. \cref{simplicial set nerve of cat face map char}). It therefore suffices to treat the case where the simplex $\tau$ does not belong to the $\Lambda^n_i$ (and therefore $\{j,k,l\}\cup\{i\}=[n]$). In this case, our assumption that $n\geq 3$ guarantees that $\{j,k,l\}=[n]\setminus\{i\}$, so either $i=1$ or $i=2$ (recall that $0<i<n$ by our hypothesis). We will treat the case $i=1$ (the case $i=2$ follows by a similar argument). Note that $\Lambda^3_1$ contains all of the nondegenerate $2$-simplices of $\Delta^3$ other than $\tau$; by applying the map $\sigma_0$, we obtain $2$-simplices of $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ which witness the identities
\[f_{30}=f_{31}\circ f_{10},\quad f_{31}=f_{32}\circ f_{21},\quad f_{20}=f_{21}\circ f_{10}.\]
It then follows that
\[f_{30}=f_{31}\circ f_{10}=(f_{32}\circ f_{21})\circ f_{10}=f_{32}\circ(f_{21}\circ f_{10})=f_{32}\circ f_{20}\]
so that $f_{lj}=f_{lk}\circ f_{kj}$, as desired.\par
It remains to treat the case $n=2$, so that we must also have $i=1$. In this situation, the map $\sigma_0:\Lambda^n_i\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ determines a pair of composable morphisms $f_{1,0}:C_0\to C_1$ and $f_{21}:C_1\to C_2$. This data extends uniquely to a $2$-simplex $\sigma$ of $\mathcal{C}$ satisfying $d_1(\sigma)=f_{21}\circ f_{10}$.
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}\label{simplicial set satisfy condition Ner map prop}
Let $f:S_\bullet\to T_\bullet$ be a map of simplicial sets. Assume that $f$ induces bijections $S_0\to T_0$ and $S_1\to T_1$, and that both $S_\bullet$ and $T_\bullet$ satisfy condition (Ner). Then $f$ is an isomorphism.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We claim that for every simplicial set $K_\bullet$, composing with $f$ induces a bijection
\[\theta_{K_\bullet}:\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(K_\bullet,S_\bullet)\to\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(K_\bullet,T_\bullet)\]
Writing $K_\bullet$ as a union of its skeleta $\sk_n(K_\bullet)$, we can reduce to the case where $K$ has dimension $\leq n$, for some integer $n\geq -1$. We now proceed by induction on $n$. The case $n=-1$ is trivial (since a simplicial set of dimension $\leq -1$ is empty). Let us therefore assume that $n\geq 0$, so that \cref{simplicial set skeleton pushout square} gives a pushout diagram of simplicial sets
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\coprod\partial\Delta^n\ar[r]\ar[d]&\coprod\Delta^n\ar[d]\\
\sk_{n-1}(K_\bullet)\ar[r]&K_\bullet
\end{tikzcd}\]
It follows from our inductive hypothesis that the maps $\theta_{\partial\Delta^n}$ and $\theta_{\sk_{n-1}(K_\bullet)}$ are bijective. Consequently, to show that $\theta_{K_\bullet}$ is bijective, it suffices to show that $\theta_{\Delta^n}$ is bijective: that is, $f$ induces a bijection $S_n\to T_n$. For $n=1$, this follows from our hypothesis. To handle the case $n\geq 2$, we observe that there is a commutative diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Delta^n,S_\bullet)\ar[r]\ar[d,swap,"\theta_{\Delta^n}"]&\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Lambda^n_1,S_\bullet)\ar[d,"\theta_{\Lambda^n_1}"]\\
\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Delta^n,T_\bullet)\ar[r]&\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Lambda^n_1,T_\bullet)
\end{tikzcd}\]
Here the right vertical map is bijective by our inductive hypothesis, and the horizontal maps are bijective by our assumption that both $S_\bullet$ and $T_\bullet$ satisfy condition (Ner). It follows that the left vertical map is also bijective, as desired.
\end{proof}
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set isomorphic to nerve iff condition Ner}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set. Then $S_\bullet$ is isomorphic to the nerve of a category if and only if it satisfies condition (Ner).
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set satisfying condition (Ner); we will show that there is a category $\mathcal{C}$ and an isomorphism of simplicial sets $u:S_\bullet\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ (the converse assertion follows from \cref{simplicial set nerve of cat satisfy condition Ner}). It follows from \cref{simplicial set nerve of cat fully faithful} that the category $\mathcal{C}$ is uniquely determined (up to isomorphism), and from the proof of \cref{simplicial set nerve of cat fully faithful} we can extract an explicit construction of $\mathcal{C}$:
\begin{itemize}
\item The objects of $\mathcal{C}$ are the vertices of $S_\bullet$.
\item Given a pair of objects $C,D\in\mathcal{C}$, we let $\Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(C,D)$ denote the collection of edges $e$ of $S_\bullet$ satisfying $d_0(e)=D$ and $d_1(e)=C$.
\item For each object $C\in\mathcal{C}$, we define the identity morphism $\id_C\in\Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(C,C)$ to be the degenerate edge $s_0(C)$.
\item Given a triple of objects $C,D,E\in\mathcal{C}$ and a pair of morphisms $f\in\Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(C,D)$ and $g\in\Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(D,E)$, we can apply condition (Ner) (in the special case $n=2$ and $i=1$) to conclude that there is a unique $2$-simplex $\sigma$ of $S_\bullet$ satisfying $d_2(\sigma)=f$ and $d_0(\sigma)=g$. We define the composition $g\circ f\in\Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(C,E)$ to be the edge $d_1(\sigma)$.
\end{itemize}
We claim that $\mathcal{C}$ is a category. For this, we must check the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item The composition law on $\mathcal{C}$ is unital: for every morphism $f:C\to D$ in $\mathcal{C}$, we have equalities
\[\id_D\circ f=f=f\circ\id_C.\]
We verify the first equality since the proof in the other case is similar. For this, we can construct a $2$-simplex $\sigma$ of $S_\bullet$ such that $d_0(\sigma)=\id_D$ and $d_1(\sigma)=d_2(\sigma)=f$. The degenerate $2$-simplex $s_1(f)$ has these properties.
\item The composition law on $\mathcal{C}$ is associative. That is, for every triple of composable morphisms
\[f:W\to X,\quad g:X\to Y,\quad h:Y\to Z\]
in $\mathcal{C}$, we have an identity $h\circ(g\circ f)=(h\circ g)\circ f$ in the category $\mathcal{C}$. Applying condition (Ner) repeatedly, we deduce the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item There is a unique $2$-simplex $\sigma_0$ of $\mathcal{C}$ satisfying $d_0(\sigma_0)=h$ and $d_2(\sigma_0)=g$ (it follows that $d_1(\sigma_0)=h\circ g$).
\item There is a unique $2$-simplex $\sigma_3$ of $\mathcal{C}$ satisfying $d_3(\sigma_0)=g$ and $d_2(\sigma_3)=f$ (it follows that $d_1(\sigma_3)=g\circ f$).
\item There is a unique $2$-simplex $\sigma_2$ of $\mathcal{C}$ satisfying $d_0(\sigma_2)=h\circ g$ and $d_2(\sigma_2)=f$ (it follows that $d_1(\sigma_2)=(h\circ g)\circ f$).
\item There is a unique $3$-simplex $\tau$ of $\mathcal{C}$ satisfying $d_0(\tau)=\sigma_0$, $d_2(\tau)=\sigma_2$, and $d_3(\tau)=\sigma_3$.
\end{itemize}
The $3$-simplex $\tau$ can be depicted in the following diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=15mm,column sep=15mm]
&X\ar[r,"g"]&Y\ar[rd,"h"]&\\
W\ar[ru,"f"]\ar[rru,"g\circ f"{anchor=south}]\ar[rrr,"(h\circ g)\circ f"]&&&Z\ar[llu,crossing over,leftarrow,"h\circ g"{anchor=south}]
\end{tikzcd}\]
Set $\sigma_1=d_1(\tau)$, then $\sigma_1$ is a $2$-simplex of $S_\bullet$ satisfying $d_0(\sigma_1)=h$, $d_1(\sigma_1)=(h\circ g)\circ f$, and $d_2(\sigma_1)=g\circ f$. It follows that $\sigma_1$ "witnesses" the identity $h\circ(g\circ f)=(h\circ g)\circ f$.
\end{itemize}
Note that every $n$-simplex $\sigma:\Delta^n\to S_\bullet$ determines a functor $[n]\to\mathcal{C}$, given on objects by the values of $\sigma$ on the vertices of $\Delta^n$ and on morphisms by the values of $\sigma$ on the edges of $\Delta^n$. This construction determines a map of simplicial sets $u:S_\bullet\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$, which is clearly bijective on simplices of dimension $\leq 1$. Since the simplicial sets $S_\bullet$ and $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ both satisfy condition (Ner), it follows from \cref{simplicial set satisfy condition Ner map prop} that $u$ is an isomorphism.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
The characterization of \cref{simplicial set isomorphic to nerve iff condition Ner} has many variants. For example, one can replace condition (Ner) by the following a priori weaker condition:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=40pt]
\item[(Ner')] For every $n\geq 2$ and every map of simplicial sets $\sigma_0:\Lambda^n_1\to S_\bullet$, there exists a unique map $\sigma:\Delta^n\to S_\bullet$ satisfying $\sigma_0=\sigma|_{\Lambda^n_i}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}
According to \cref{simplicial set nerve of cat fully faithful}, every category $\mathcal{C}$ can be recovered, up to canonical isomorphism, from the nerve $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$. In particular, any isomorphism-invariant condition on a category $\mathcal{C}$ can be reformulated as a condition on the simplicial set $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$. We now illustrate this principle with a simple example, that is, the category $\mathcal{C}$ being a groupoid.
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set nerve of cat Kan iff groupoid}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category. Then $\mathcal{C}$ is a groupoid if and only if $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ is a Kan complex.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Suppose first that $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ is a Kan complex. Let $f:C\to D$ be a morphism in $\mathcal{C}$; using the surjectivity of the map $\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Delta^2,N_\bullet(\mathcal{C}))\to\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Lambda^2_2,N_\bullet(\mathcal{C}))$, we see that there exists a $2$-simplex $\sigma$ of $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ such that $d_0(\sigma)=f$ and $d_1(\sigma)=\id_D$. If we set $g=d_2(\sigma)$, then $f\circ g=\id_D$, so $g$ is a left inverse of $f$. Similarly, by considering $\Lambda^2_0$, we see there exists a map $h:D\to C$ such that $h\circ f=\id_C$. It then follows that $g=h$ and $f$ is an isomorphism, so $\mathcal{C}$ is a groupoid.
Now suppose that $\mathcal{C}$ is a groupoid. We show that for $0\leq i\leq n$, any map $\sigma_0:\Lambda_i^n\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ can be extended to an $n$-simplex $\sigma:\Delta^n\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$. For $0<i<n$, this follows from \cref{simplicial set nerve of cat satisfy condition Ner} (and does not require the assumption that $\mathcal{C}$ is a groupoid). We will treat the case where $i=0$, since the other case $i=n$ follows by similar reasoning. We consider several cases: in the case $n=1$, the map $\sigma_0:\Lambda_0^n\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ can be identified with an object $C\in\mathcal{C}$. In this case, we can take $\sigma$ to be an edge of $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ corresponding to any morphism with target $\mathcal{C}$ (for example, we can take $\sigma$ to be the identity map $\id_C$). In the case $n=2$, we can identify $\sigma_0$ with a pair of morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$ having the same source, which we can depict as a diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
&D\ar[rd,dashed]&\\
C\ar[ru,"f"]\ar[rr,"g"]&&E
\end{tikzcd}\]
Our assumption that $\mathcal{C}$ is a groupoid guarantees that we can extend this diagram to a $2$-simplex of $\mathcal{C}$, whose $0$-th face is given by the morphism $g\circ f^{-1}:D\to E$.\par
Finally, in the case $n\geq 3$, the map $\sigma_0$ determines a collection of objects $\{C_i\}_{0\leq i\leq n}$ and morphisms $f_{ji}:C_i\to C_j$ for $i\leq j$. We show that these morphisms determine a functor $[n]\to\mathcal{C}$ (which we can then identify with an $n$-simplex $\sigma$ of $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ satisfying $\sigma_0=\sigma|_{\Lambda^n_0}$). For this, we must verify the identity $f_{kj}\circ f_{ji}=f_{ki}$ for $0\leq i\leq j\leq k\leq n$. Note that this identity is satisfied whenever the triple $(i,j,k)$ determines a $2$-simplex of $\Delta^n$ belonging to the horn $\Lambda^n_0$. This is automatic unless $n=3$ and $(i,j,k)=(1,2,3)$. To handle this exceptional case, we note that
\begin{align*}
(f_{32}\circ f_{21})\circ f_{10}&=f_{22}\circ (f_{21}\circ f_{10})=f_{32}\circ f_{20}=f_{30}.
\end{align*}
Since C is a groupoid, composing with $f_{10}^{-1}$ on the right yields the desired identity $f_{32}\circ f_{21}=f_{31}$.
\end{proof}
\begin{example}
Let $M$ be a monoid. We can then form a category $BM$ having a single object $X$, where $\Hom_{BM}(X,X)=M$ and the composition of morphisms in $BM$ is given by multiplication in $M$. We will denote the nerve of the category $BM$ by $B_\bullet M$. In the special case where $M=G$ is a group, the geometric realization $|B_\bullet G|$ is a topological space called the \textbf{classifying space} of $G$. It can be characterized (up to homotopy equivalence) by the fact that it is a CW complex with either of the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item The space $|B_\bullet G|$ is connected, and its homotopy groups (with respect to any choice of base point) are given by the formula
\[\pi_*(|B_\bullet G|)=\begin{cases}
G&\text{if $\ast=1$},\\
0&\text{if $\ast>1$}.
\end{cases}\]
\item For any paracompact topological space $X$, there is a canonical bijection
\[\{\text{continuous maps $f:X\to|B_\bullet G|$}\}/\text{homotopy}\stackrel{\sim}{\to}\{\text{$G$-torsors $P\to X$}\}/\text{isomorphism}.\]
\end{itemize}
\end{example}
\subsection{Homotopy category of a simplicial set}
Recall that the functor $N_\bullet$ can be identified with $\Sing_\bullet^Q$, where $Q:\Delta\to\mathbf{Cat}$ is the functor sending $[n]\in\Delta$ to itself, considered as a category. By \cref{simplicial set Sing^Q functor adjoint}, $N_\bullet$ then admits a left adjoint, which is the functor that sends a simplicial set to its homotopy category as we shall now define.\par
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category. We will say that a map of simplicial sets $u:S_\bullet\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ exhibits $\mathcal{C}$ as the homotopy category of $S_\bullet$ if, for every category $\mathcal{D}$, the composite map
\[\Hom_{\mathbf{Cat}}(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})\to\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(N_\bullet(\mathcal{C}),N_\bullet(\mathcal{D}))\stackrel{\circ u}{\to}\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(S_\bullet,N_\bullet(\mathcal{D}))\]
is bijective (note that since $N_\bullet$ is fully faithful, the first map is always bijective).
\begin{example}
Let $X$ be a category and $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ be the singular simplicial set of $X$. We consider the fundamental groupoid $\Pi(X)$ of $X$, which is defined in the begining of this chapter. Then there exists a unique map of simplicial sets $u:\Sing_\bullet(X)\to N_\bullet(\Pi(X))$ with teh following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item On $0$-simplicies, $u$ sends each point $x\in X$ to itself, considered as an object of $\Pi(X)$.
\item On $1$-simplicies, $u$ sends a path $p:[0,1]\to X$ (considered as an edge of $\Sing_\bullet(X)$) to its homotopy class $[p]$ (as a morphism of $\Pi(X)$).
\item On $n$-simplicies, $u$ sends a continuous map $|\Delta^n|\to X$ to the functor that associates each element $i\in[n]$ with $\sigma(i)$, and each morphism $(i\leq j)$ with the homotopy class of the path $\sigma_{ij}$ defined by the restriction of $\sigma$ on the edge from $i$ to $j$ in $|\Delta^n|$.
\end{itemize}\label{simplicial set Sing(X) homotopy cat is Pi(X)}
Moreover, for any category $\mathcal{C}$, the map
\[\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(N_\bullet(\Pi(X)),N_\bullet(\mathcal{C}))\to\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Sing_\bullet(X),N_\bullet(\mathcal{C}))\]
is bijective. In fact, any homotopy of paths $\sigma,\sigma'$ in $X$ can be written as a continuous map $\tau\in\Sing_2(X)$ such that $d_0(\tau)=s_0(x)$, $d_1(\tau)=\sigma$ and $d_2(\tau)=\sigma'$. If $f:\Sing_\bullet(X)\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ is a map of simplicial sets, then $f$ sends $\tau$ to a $2$-simplex in $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$, which means
\[f(\sigma)=\id_{f(x)}\circ f(\sigma'),\]
so $f$ is constant on homotopy classes. This indicates that $f$ descents to a uniquely determined map $N_\bullet(\Pi(X))\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ of simplicial sets, so we therefore conclude that $u$ exhibits the fundamental groupoid $\Pi(X)$ as a homotopy category of the singular simplicial set $\Sing_\bullet(X)$.
\end{example}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set. It follows immediately from the definition that if there exists a category $\mathcal{C}$ and a map $u:S_\bullet\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ which exhibits $\mathcal{C}$ as a homotopy category of $S_\bullet$, then the category $\mathcal{C}$ is unique up to isomorphism and depends functorially on $S_\bullet$. To emphasize this dependence, we will refer to $\mathcal{C}$ as the homotopy category of $S_\bullet$ and denote it by $h(S_\bullet)$.
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set homotopy cat exist}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set. Then there exists a category $\mathcal{C}$ and a map of simplicial sets $u:S_\bullet\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ which exhibits $\mathcal{C}$ as a homotopy category of $S_\bullet$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $Q^\bullet$ denote the cosimplicial object of $\mathbf{Cat}$ given by the inclusion $\Delta\hookrightarrow\mathbf{Cat}$. Unwinding the definitions, we see that a homotopy category of $S_\bullet$ can be identified with a realization $|S_\bullet|^Q$, whose existence is a special case of \cref{simplicial set Sing^Q functor adjoint}. Alternatively, we can give a direct construction of the homotopy category $h(S_\bullet)$:
\begin{itemize}
\item The objects of $h(S_\bullet)$ are the vertices of $S_\bullet$.
\item Every edge $e$ of $S_\bullet$ determines a morphism $[e]$ in $h(S_\bullet)$, whose source is the vertex $d_1(e)$ and whose target is the vertex $d_0(e)$.
\item The collection of morphisms in $h(S_\bullet)$ is generated under composition by morphisms of the form $[e]$, subject only to the relations
\begin{gather*}
[s_0(x)]=\id_x\for x\in S_0,\\
[d_1(\sigma)]=[d_0(\sigma)]\circ[d_2(\sigma)]\for \sigma\in S_2.
\end{gather*}
\end{itemize}
As in \cref{simplicial set Sing(X) homotopy cat is Pi(X)}, it is easy to verify that the defined class $h(S_\bullet)$ is indeed a category and the canonical map $u:S_\bullet\to N_\bullet(h(S_\bullet))$ exhibits $h(S_\bullet)$ as a homotopy category of $S_\bullet$. 
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}\label{simplicial set nerve and homotopy cat adjoint}
The nerve functor $N_\bullet:\mathbf{Cat}\to\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$ admits a left adjoint, given on $S_\bullet\to h(S_\bullet)$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{remark}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category. Then the counit of the adjunction in \cref{simplicial set nerve and homotopy cat adjoint} induces an isomorphism of categories $h(N_\bullet(\mathcal{C}))\cong\mathcal{C}$ (this is a restatement of \cref{simplicial set nerve of cat fully faithful}). In other words, every category $\mathcal{C}$ can be recovered as the homotopy category of its nerve $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set. Our proof of \cref{simplicial set homotopy cat exist} gives a construction of the homotopy category $h(S_\bullet)$ by generators and relations. The result of this construction is not easy to describe. If $x$ and $y$ are vertices of $S_\bullet$, then every morphism from $x$ to $y$ in $h(S_\bullet)$ can be represented by a composition
\[[e_n]\circ[e_{n-1}]\circ\cdots\circ[e_1]\]
where $\{e_i\}_{0\leq i\leq n}$ is a sequence of edges satisfying
\[d_1(e_1)=x,\quad d_0(e_i)=d_1(e_{i+1}),\quad d_0(e_n)=y.\]
In general, it can be difficult to determine whether or not two such compositions represent the same morphism of $h(S_\bullet)$ (even for finite simplicial sets, this question is algorithmically undecidable). However, there are two situations in which the homotopy category $h(S_\bullet)$ admits a simpler description:
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set of dimension $\leq 1$, which we can identify with a directed graph $G$ (\cref{simplicial set graph functor on dim 1 faithful}). In this case, the homotopy category $h(S_\bullet)$ is generated freely by the vertices and edges of the graph $G$: that is, it can be identified with the \textit{path category} of $G$.
\item Let $S_\bullet$ be an $\infty$-category (we will define this later). In this case, every morphism in the homotopy category $C=h(S_\bullet)$ can be represented by a single edge of $S_\bullet$, rather than a composition of edges (in other words, the canonical map $u:S_\bullet\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ is surjective on edges), and two edges of $S_\bullet$ represent the same morphism in $h(S_\bullet)$ if and only if they are homotopic. This leads to a more explicit description of the homotopy category $\mathcal{C}$ which generalize \cref{simplicial set Sing(X) homotopy cat is Pi(X)}.
\end{itemize}
\end{remark}
\subsection{Path category of a directed graph}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set of dimension $\leq 1$. In this paragraph, we will show that the homotopy category $h(S_\bullet)$ admits a concrete description, which can be conveniently described using the language of directed graphs.\par
Let $G$ be a directed graph. For each edge $e\in E(G)$, we let $s(e),t(e)\in V(G)$ denote the source and target of $e$, respectively. If $x$ and $y$ are vertices of $V(G)$, then a path from $x$ to $y$ is a sequence of edges $(e_n,e_{n-1},\dots,e_1)$ satisfying
\[s(e_1)=x,\quad t(e_i)=s(e_{i+1}),\quad t(e_n)=y.\]
 By convention, we regard the empty sequence of edges as a path from each vertex $x\in V(G)$. to itself. We define a category $P[G]$ as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item The objects of $P[G]$ are the vertices of $G$.
\item For every pair of vertices $x,y\in V(G)$, we let $\Hom_{P[G]}(x,y)$ denote the set of all paths $(e_n,\dots,e_1)$ from $x$ to $y$.
\item For every vertex $x\in V(G)$, the identity morphism $\id_x$ in the category $P[G]$ is the empty path from $x$ to itself.
\item Let $x,y,z\in V(G)$. The composition law
\[\circ:\Hom_{P[G]}(y,z)\times\Hom_{P[G]}(x,y)\to\Hom_{P[G]}(x,z)\]
is described by the formula
\[(e_n,\dots,e_1)\circ(t_m,\dots,t_1)=(e_n,\dots,e_1,t_m,\dots,t_1).\]
In other words, composition in $P[G]$ is given by concatentation of paths.
\end{itemize}
The category $P[G]$ is called the \textbf{path category} of the directed graph $G$.
\begin{example}
Fix an integer $n\geq 0$ and let $G$ be the directed graph with vertex set $V(G)=\{v_0,v_1,\dots,v_n\}$, and edge set $E(G)=\{e_1,\dots,e_n\}$, where each edge $e_i$ has source $s(e_i)=v_{i-1}$ and target $t(e_i)=v_i$; we can represent $G$ graphically by the diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
v_0\ar[r,"e_1"]&v_1\ar[r,"e_2"]&\cdots\ar[r,"e_{n-1}"]&v_{n-1}\ar[r,"e_n"]&v_n.
\end{tikzcd}\]
Let $v_i$ and $v_j$ be a pair of vertices of $G$, then there is a (necessarily unique) path from $v_i$ to $v_j$ if and only if $i\leq j$, given by $(e_j,e_{j-1},\dots,e_{i+1})$. It follows that the path category $P[G]$ is isomorphic to the linearly ordered set $[n]$ (regarded as a category).
\end{example}
\begin{example}
Let $G$ be a directed graph having a single vertex $V(G)=\{x\}$. Then the path category $P[G]$ has a single object $x$, and can therefore be identified with the category $BM$ associated to the monoid $M=\End_{P[G]}(x)=\Hom_{P[G]}(x,x)$. Note that the elements of $M$ can be identified with (possibly empty) sequences of elements of the set $E(G)$, and that the multiplication on $M$ is given by concatenation of sequences. In other words, $M$ can be identified with the \textit{free monoid} generated by the set $E(M)$ (this identification is not completely tautological: it can be regarded as a special case of \cref{simplicial set graph homotopy cat is path cat} below).
\end{example}
\begin{example}
Let $G$ be a directed graph having a single vertex $V(G)=\{x\}$ and a single edge $E(G)=\{e\}$ (necessarily satisfying $s(e)=x=t(e)$). Then the path category $P[G]$ has a single object $x$ whose endomorphism monoid $\End_{P[G]}(x)$ can be identified with the set $\N$ of nonnegative integers (with monoid structure given by addition).
\end{example}
Let $G$ be a directed graph, and let $G_\bullet$ denote the associated $1$-dimensional simplicial set. Then there is an evident map of simplicial sets $u:G_\bullet\to N_\bullet(P[G])$, which carries each vertex $v\in V(G)$ to itself and each edge $e\in E(G)$ to the path consisting of the single edge $e$.
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set graph homotopy cat is path cat}
Let $G$ be a directed graph. Then the map $u:G_\bullet\to N_\bullet(P[G])$ exhibits $P[G]$ as the homotopy category of the simplicial set $G_\bullet$. In other words, for every category $\mathcal{C}$, the composite map
\[\Hom_{\mathbf{Cat}}(P[G],\mathcal{C})\to\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(N_\bullet(P[G]),N_\bullet(\mathcal{C}))\stackrel{\circ u}{\to}\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(G_\bullet,N_\bullet(\mathcal{C}))\]
is a bijection.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $f:G_\bullet\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ be a map of simplicial sets. We want to show that there is a unique functor $F:P[G]\to\mathcal{C}$ for which the composite map
\[\begin{tikzcd}
G_\bullet\ar[r,"u"]&N_\bullet(P[G])\ar[r,"N_\bullet(F)"]&N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})
\end{tikzcd}
\]
coincides with $f$. Unwinding the definitions, we see that this agreement imposes the following requirements on $F$:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] For each vertex $v\in V(G)$, we have $F(x)=f(x)$ (as an object in $\mathcal{C}$).
\item[(b)] For each edge $e\in E(G)$ having $x=s(e)$ and target $y=t(e)$, the functor $F$ carries the path $(e)$ to the morphism $f(e):f(x)\to f(y)$ in $\mathcal{C}$.
\end{itemize}
The existence and uniqueness of the functor $F$ is now clear: it is determined on objects by property (a), and on morphisms by the formula
\begin{equation*}
F(e_n,e_{n-1},\dots,e_1)=f(e_n)\circ f(e_{n-1})\circ\cdots\circ f(e_1).\qedhere
\end{equation*}
\end{proof}
A category $\mathcal{C}$ is \textbf{free} if it is isomorphic to $P[G]$, for some directed graph $G$. We now give a characterization of those categories which are free.\par
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be any category. We say that a morphism $f:X\to Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is \textbf{indecomposable} if $f$ is not an identity morphism, and for every factorization $f=g\circ h$ have either $g=\id_Y$ (so $h=f$) or $h=\id_X$ (so $g=f$). We now define a directed graph $\Gamma_0(\mathcal{C})$ as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item The vertices of$\Gamma_0(\mathcal{C})$ are the objects of $\mathcal{C}$.
\item The edges of $\Gamma_0(\mathcal{C})$ are the indecomposable morphisms of $\mathcal{C}$ (where an indecomposable morphism $f:X\to Y$ is regarded as an edge with source $s(f)=X$ and target $t(f)=Y$).
\end{itemize}
By definition, the graph $\Gamma_0(\mathcal{C})$ comes equipped with a canonical map $\Gamma_0(\mathcal{C})_\bullet\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$, which we can identify (by means of \cref{simplicial set graph homotopy cat is path cat}) with a functor $F:P[\Gamma_0(\mathcal{C})]\to\mathcal{C}$.
\begin{proposition}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category. The following conditions on $\mathcal{C}$ are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(\rmnum{1})] The category $\mathcal{C}$ is free. That is, there exists a directed graph $G$ and an isomorphism of categories $C\cong P[G]$.
\item[(\rmnum{2})] The functor $F:P[\Gamma_0(\mathcal{C})]\to\mathcal{C}$ is an isomorphism of categories.
\item[(\rmnum{3})] The functor $F:P[\Gamma_0(\mathcal{C})]\to\mathcal{C}$ is an equivalence of categories.
\item[(\rmnum{4})] The functor $F:P[\Gamma_0(\mathcal{C})]\to\mathcal{C}$ is fully faithful.
\item[(\rmnum{5})] Every morphism $f$ in $\mathcal{C}$ admits a unique factorization $f=f_n\circ f_{n-1}\circ\cdots\circ f_1$, where each $f_i$ is an indecomposable morphism of $\mathcal{C}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The functor $F$ is bijective on objects, which shows that (\rmnum{2})$\Leftrightarrow$(\rmnum{3})$\Leftrightarrow$(\rmnum{4}). The equivalence of (\rmnum{4}) and (\rmnum{5}) follows from the definition of morphisms in the path category $P[\Gamma_0(\mathcal{C})]$. The implication (\rmnum{2})$\Rightarrow$(\rmnum{1}) is immediate, and the converse follows from the observation that a path $(e_n,e_{n-1},\dots,e_1)$ in $P[G]$ is indecomposable if and only if $n=1$.
\end{proof}
\section{\boldmath\texorpdfstring{$\infty$}{inf}-categories}
Up to now, we have encountered two closely related conditions on a simplicial set $S_\bullet$:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=40pt]
\item[(Kan)] For any positive integer $n>0$ and $0\leq i\leq n$, any map of simplicial sets $\sigma_0:\Lambda^n_i\to S_\bullet$ can be extended into a map $\sigma:\Delta^n\to S_\bullet$, where $\Lambda^n_i$ is the $i$-th horn.
\item[(Ner)] For any pair of integers $0<i<n$, any map of simplicial sets $\sigma_0:\Lambda_i^n\to S_\bullet$ can be uniquely extended into a map $\sigma:\Delta^n\to S_\bullet$.
\end{enumerate}
Simplicial sets satisfying (Kan) are called Kan complexes and form the basis for a combinatorial approach to homotopy theory, while simplicial sets satisfying (Ner) can be identified with categories. These notions admit a common generalization, which we shall define now.\par
An \textbf{$\infty$-category} is a simplicial set $S_\bullet$ which satisfies the following weak Kan extension condition:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=40pt]
\item[(Kan')] For any pair of integers $0<i<n$, any map of simplicial sets $\sigma_0:\Lambda^n_i\to S_\bullet$ can be extended into a map $\sigma:\Delta^n\to S_\bullet$, where $\Lambda^n_i$ is the $i$-th horn.
\end{enumerate}
It follows from this definition that every Kan complex is an $\infty$-category. In particular, if $X$ is a topological space, then the singular simplicial set $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ is an $\infty$-category. Also, for every category $\mathcal{C}$, the nerve $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ is an $\infty$-category. 
\begin{example}[\textbf{Product of $\infty$-categories}]\label{simplicial set product of inf-cat}
Let $\{S_\bullet^\alpha\}_{\alpha\in I}$ be a collection of simplicial sets and $S_\bullet=\prod_{\alpha}S_\bullet^\alpha$ denote their product. If each $S_\bullet^\alpha$ is an $\infty$-category, then $S_\bullet$ is an 1-category. The converse holds provided that each $S_\bullet^\alpha$ is nonempty.
\end{example}
\begin{example}[\textbf{Coproducts of $\infty$-categories}]\label{simplicial set coproduct of inf-cat}
Let $\{S_\bullet^\alpha\}_{\alpha\in I}$ be a collection of simplicial sets parametrized by a set $I$, and $S_\bullet=\coprod_{\alpha}S_\bullet^\alpha$ be their coproduct. For each $0<i<n$, the restriction map
\[\theta:\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Delta^n,S_\bullet)\to\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Lambda_i^n,S_\bullet)\]
can be identified with the coproduct (formed in the arrow category $\Fun([1],\mathbf{Set}))$ of restriction maps $\theta_\alpha:\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Delta^n,S_\bullet^\alpha)\to\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Lambda^n_i,S_\bullet^\alpha)$ (this follows from the observation that
the simplicial sets $\Delta^n$ and $\Lambda_i^n$ are connected). It follows that $\theta$ is surjective if and only if each $\theta_\alpha$ is surjective. Allowing $n$ and $i$ to vary, we conclude that $S_\bullet$ is an $\infty$-category if and only if each summand $S_\bullet^\alpha$ is an $\infty$-category. In particular, if $S_\bullet$ is a simplicial set, then $S_\bullet$ is an $\infty$-category if and only if each connected component of $S_\bullet$ is an $\infty$-category.
\end{example}
\begin{remark}
Suppose that we are given a filtered diagram of simplicial sets $\{S(\alpha)_\bullet\}$ having colimit $S_\bullet=\rlim S(\alpha)_\bullet$. If each $S(\alpha)_\bullet$ is an $\infty$-category, then $S_\bullet$ is an $\infty$-category.
\end{remark}
We will generally use calligraphic letters (like $\mathcal{C}$, $\mathcal{D}$, and $\mathcal{E}$) to denote $\infty$-categories, and we will generally describe them using terminology borrowed from category theory. For example, if $C=S_\bullet$ is an $\infty$-category, then we will refer to vertices of the simplicial set $S_\bullet$ as objects of the $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, and to edges of the simplicial set $S_\bullet$ as morphisms of the $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$. One of the central themes of this exposition is that $\infty$-categories behave much like ordinary categories. In particular, for any $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, there is a notion of composition for morphisms of $\mathcal{C}$. Given a pair of morphisms $f:X\to Y$ and $g:Y\to X$ in $\mathcal{C}$ (corresponding to edges $f,g\in S_1$ satisfying $d_0(f)=d_1(g)$), the pair $(f,g)$ defines a map of simplicial sets $\sigma_0:\Lambda^2_1\to\mathcal{C}$. Applying condition (Kan'), we can extend $\sigma_0$ to a $2$-simplex $\sigma$ of $\mathcal{C}$, which we can think of heuristically as a commutative diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
&Y\ar[rd,"g"]&\\
X\ar[ru,"f"]\ar[rr,dashed,"h"]&&Z
\end{tikzcd}\]
In this case, the morphism $h=d_1(\sigma)$ is called a composition of $f$ and $g$. However, this comes with a caveat: the extension $\sigma$ is usually not unique (rather than the case in categories, where we have condition (Ner)), so the morphism $h$ is not completely determined by $f$ and $g$. However, we will show that it is unique up to a certain notion of homotopy, and we will apply this observation to give a concrete description of the homotopy category $h(\mathcal{C})$ when $\mathcal{C}$ is an $\infty$-category.
\subsection{Objects and morphisms}
Let $\mathcal{C}=S_\bullet$ be an $\infty$-category. An \textbf{object} of $\mathcal{C}$ is a vertex of the simplicial set $S_\bullet$ (that is, an element of the set $S_0$). A morphism of $\mathcal{C}$ is an edge of the simplicial set $S_\bullet$ (that is, an element of $S_1$). If $f\in S_1$ is a morphism of $\mathcal{C}$, the objects $X=d_1(f)$ and $Y=d_0(f)$ are called the \textbf{source} and \textbf{target} of $f$, respectively. In this case, we say that $f$ is a morphism from $X$ to $Y$. For any object $X$ of $\mathcal{C}$, we can regard the degenerate edge $s_0(X)$ as a morphism from $X$ to itself; this is denoted by $\id_X$ and called the \textbf{identity morphism} of $X$. We often write $X\in\mathcal{C}$ to indicate that $X$ is an object of $\mathcal{C}$, and we use the phrase "$f:X\to Y$ is a morphism of $\mathcal{C}$" to indicate that $f$ is a morphism of $\mathcal{C}$ having source $X$ and target $Y$.
\begin{example}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an ordinary category, and regard the simplicial set $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ as an $\infty$-category. Then the objects of the $\infty$-category $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ are the objects of $\mathcal{C}$, and the morphisms of the $\infty$-category $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ are the morphisms of $\mathcal{C}$. Moreover, the source and target of a morphism of $\mathcal{C}$ coincide with the source and target of the corresponding morphism in $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$. Also note that for every object $X\in\mathcal{C}$, the identity morphism $\id_X$ does not depend on whether we view $X$ as an object of the category $\mathcal{C}$ or the $\infty$-category $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
Let $X$ be a topological space, and regard the simplicial set $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ as an $\infty$-category. Then the objects of $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ are the points of $X$, and the morphisms of $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ are continuous paths $f:[0,1]\to X$. The source of a morphism $f$ is the point $f(0)$, and the target is the point $f(1)$. Also, for every point $x\in X$, the identity morphism $\id_x$ is the constant path $[0,1]\to X$ taking the value $x$.
\end{example}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an ordinary category. Then we can construct a new category $\mathcal{C}^{\op}$, called the opposite category of $\mathcal{C}$, by the formula
\[\Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{\op}}(C,D)=\Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(D,C).\]
As we will see, the construction $\mathcal{C}\mapsto\mathcal{C}^{\op}$ admits a straightforward generalization to the setting of $\infty$-categories. In fact, it can be extended to arbitrary simplicial sets.\par
Let $\mathbf{Lin}$ denote the category whose objects are finite linearly ordered sets and whose morphisms are nondecreasing functions. Let $I$ be an object of $\mathbf{Lin}$, regarded as a set with a linear ordering $\preceq_I$. We let $I^{\op}$ denote the same set with the opposite ordering, so that
\[(i\preceq_{I^{\op}}j)\Leftrightarrow(j\preceq_I i).\]
Recall that the simplex category $\Delta$ is the full subcategory of $\mathbf{Lin}$ spanned by objects of the form $[n]$, and is equivalent to the full subcategory of $\mathbf{Lin}$ spanned by those linearly ordered sets which are finite and nonempty. There is a unique functor $\op:\Delta\to\Delta$ for which the diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\Delta\ar[r]\ar[d,swap,"\op"]&\mathbf{Lin}\ar[d,"I\mapsto I^{\op}"]\\
\Delta\ar[r]&\mathbf{Lin}
\end{tikzcd}\]
commutes up to isomorphism, where the horizontal maps are given by the inclusion. The functor $\op$ can be described more concretely as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item For each object $[n]\in\Delta$, we have $\op([n])=[n]$ (note that the maps $i\mapsto n-i$ determines an isomorphism of $[n]$ with the opposite linear ordering $[n]^{\op}$).
\item For each morphism $\alpha:[m]\to[n]$ in $\Delta$, the morphism $\op(\alpha):[m]\to[n]$ is given by $\op(\alpha)(i)=n-\alpha(m-i)$.
\end{itemize}
Now let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set, which we consider as a functor $\Delta^{\op}\to\mathbf{Set}$. We denote by $S_\bullet^\bullet$ the simplicial set given by the composition
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\Delta^{\op}\ar[r,"\op"]&\Delta^{\op}\ar[r,"S_\bullet"]&\mathbf{Set}
\end{tikzcd}\]
We say that $S_\bullet^{\op}$ is the \textbf{opposite} of the simplicial set $S_\bullet$. By definition, it is defined by the following datum:
\begin{itemize}
\item For each $n\geq 0$, we have $S_n^{\op}=S_n$.
\item The face and degeneracy maps of $S_\bullet^{\op}$ are given by
\[(d_i:S_n^{\op}\to S_{n-1}^{\op})=(d_{n-i}:S_n\to S_{n-1}),\quad (s_i:S_n^{\op}\to S_{n+1}^{\op})=(s_{n-i}:S_n\to S_{n+1}).\]
\end{itemize}
\begin{example}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category. For each $n\geq 0$, we can identify $n$-simplices $\sigma$ of $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ with diagrams
\[\begin{tikzcd}
C_0\ar[r,"f_1"]&C_1\ar[r,"f_2"]&\cdots\ar[r,"f_{n-1}"]&C_{n-1}\ar[r,"f_n"]&C_n
\end{tikzcd}\]
in the category $\mathcal{C}$. Then $\sigma$ determines an $n$-simplex $\sigma^{\op}$ of $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C}^{\op})$, given by the diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
C_n\ar[r,"f_n"]&C_{n-1}\ar[r,"f_{n-1}"]&\cdots\ar[r,"f_2"]&C_1\ar[r,"f_1"]&C_0
\end{tikzcd}\]
in the opposite category $\mathcal{C}^{\op}$. The construction $\sigma\mapsto\sigma^{\op}$ determines an isomorphism of simplicial sets $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})^{\op}\cong N_\bullet(\mathcal{C}^{\op})$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
Let $X$ be a topological space. Then there is a canonical isomorphism of simplicial set $\Sing_\bullet(X)\cong\Sing_\bullet(X)^{\op}$, which carries a singular $n$-simplex $\sigma:|\Delta^n|\to X$ to the composition map
\[\begin{tikzcd}
{|\Delta^n|}\ar[r,"r"]&{|\Delta^n|}\ar[r,"\sigma"]&X
\end{tikzcd}\]
where $r$ is the homeomorphism of $|\Delta^n|$ with itself given by $r(t_0,\dots,t_{n-1},t_n)=(t_n,\dots,t_1,t_0)$.
\end{example}
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set opposite of inf-cat is inf-cat}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category, then the opposite category $\mathcal{C}^{\op}$ is also an $\infty$-category.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $\sigma_0:\Lambda_i^n\to\mathcal{C}^{\op}$ be a map of simplicial sets for $0<i<n$. Passing to opposite simplicial sets, we are reduced to showing that the map $\sigma_0^{\op}:(\Lambda_i^n)^{\op}\to\mathcal{C}$ can be extended to a map $(\Lambda_i^n)^{\op}\to\mathcal{C}$. This follows from our assumption that $\mathcal{C}$ is an $\infty$-category, since there is a canonical isomorphism $(\Delta^n)^{\op}\cong\Delta^n$ which carries the simplicial subset $(\Lambda^n_i)^{\op}$ to $\Lambda^n_{n-i}$.
\end{proof}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category. The $\infty$-category of \cref{simplicial set opposite of inf-cat is inf-cat} is called the opposite of the $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$. Note that the objects of $\mathcal{C}^{\op}$ are the objects of $\mathcal{C}$, and given a pair of objects $X,Y\in\mathcal{C}$, the datum of a morphism from $X$ to $Y$ in $\mathcal{C}^{\op}$ is equivalent to the datum of a morphism from $Y$ to $X$ in $\mathcal{C}$.
\subsection{Homotopies of morphisms}
For any topological space $X$, we can view the singular simplicial set $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ as an $\infty$-category, where a morphism from a point $x\in X$ to a point $y\in X$ is given by a continuous path $f:[0,1]\to X$ satisfying $f(0)=x$ and $f(1)=y$. For many purposes (for example, in the study of the fundamental group $\pi_1(X,x)$), it is useful to work not with paths but with homotopy classes of paths (having fixed endpoints). This notion can be generalized to an arbitrary $\infty$-category: let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category and let $f,g:C\to D$ be a pair of morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$ having the same source and target. A \textbf{homotopy} from $f$ to $g$ is a $2$-simplex $\sigma$ of $\mathcal{C}$ satisfying $d_0(\sigma)=\id_D$, $d_1(\sigma)=g$, and $d_2(\sigma)=f$, as depicted in the diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
&D\ar[rd,"\id_D"]&\\
C\ar[ru,"f"]\ar[rr,"g"]&&D
\end{tikzcd}\]
We say that $f$ and $g$ are homotopic if there exists such a homotopy from $f$ to $g$.
\begin{example}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an ordinary category. Then a pair of morphisms $f,g:C\to D$ in $\mathcal{C}$ (having the same source and target) are homotopic as morphisms of the $\infty$-category $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ if and only if $f=g$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}\label{simplicial set Sing(X) homotopy iff path homotopy}
Let $X$ be a topological space. Suppose we are given points $x,y\in X$ and a pair of continuous paths $f,g:[0,1]\to X$ satisfying $f(0)=x=g(0)$ and $f(1)=y=g(1)$. Then $f$ and $g$ are homotopic as morphisms of the $\infty$-category $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ if and only if the paths $f$ and $g$ are homotopic relative to their endpoints: that is, if and only if there exists a continuous function $H:[0,1]\times[0,1]\to X$ satisfying
\begin{align}\label{simplicial set Sing(X) homotopy iff path homotopy-1}
H(s,0)=f(s),\quad H(s,1)=g(s),\quad H(0,t)=x,\quad H(1,t)=y.
\end{align}
To see this, let $\pi:[0,1]\times[0,1]\to|\Delta^2|$ be the continuous map given by
\[\pi(s,t)=(1-s,(1-t)s,ts).\]
Intuitively, one can think that $\pi$ pinch the edge $\{0\}\times[0,1]$ into a single point $(1,0,0)$ to give a $2$-simplex $|\Delta^2|$. The map $\sigma\mapsto\sigma\circ\pi$ then determines a map from the set $\Sing_2(X)$ of singular $2$-simplices of $X$ to the set of all continuous functions $H:[0,1]\times[0,1]\to X$, and sends homotopies from $f$ to $g$ (in the category $\Sing_\bullet(X)$) to the set of continuous functions $H$ satisfying the requirements (\ref{simplicial set Sing(X) homotopy iff path homotopy-1}). Conversely, if $H:[0,1]\times[0,1]\to X$ is a continuous function satisfying (\ref{simplicial set Sing(X) homotopy iff path homotopy-1}), then we define a $2$-simplex $\sigma:|\Delta^2|\to X$ by the formula
\[\sigma(t_0,t_1,t_2)=H(\pi^{-1}(t_0,t_1,t_2)).\]
Note that the map $\pi$ is not injective only on $\{0\}\times[0,1]$, on which $H$ takes constant values, so the map $\sigma$ is well-defined. To see $\sigma$ is continuous, it is enough to note that $\pi$ sends an open subset $U$ of $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ intersecting $\{0\}\times[0,1]$ to an open subset of $|\Delta^2|$ containing $(1,0,0)$.
\end{example}
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set inf-cat homotopy is equivalence}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category contiaining objects $X,Y\in\mathcal{C}$, and let $E$ be the collection of morphisms from $X$ to $Y$. Then homotopy is an equivalence relation on $E$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
We first observe that for any morphism $f:X\to Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$, the degenerate $2$-simplex $s_1(f)$ is a homotopy from $f$ to itself. It follows that homotopy is a reflexive relation on $E$. We will complete the proof by establishing the following:
\begin{equation}\label{simplicial set inf-cat homotopy is equivalence-1}
\parbox{\dimexpr\linewidth-6em}
{\strut
Let $f,g,h:X\to Y$ be three morphisms from $X$ to $Y$. If $f$ is homotopic to $g$ and $f$ is homotopic to $h$, then $g$ is homotopic to $h$.
\strut}
\end{equation}
Let us first observe that assertion (\ref{simplicial set inf-cat homotopy is equivalence-1}) implies \cref{simplicial set inf-cat homotopy is equivalence}. Note that in the special case $f=h$, (\ref{simplicial set inf-cat homotopy is equivalence-1}) asserts that if $f$ is homotopic to $g$, then $g$ is homotopic to $f$ (since $f$ is always homotopic to itself). That is, the relation of homotopy is symmetric. We can therefore replace the hypothesis that $f$ is homotopic to $g$ in assertion (\ref{simplicial set inf-cat homotopy is equivalence-1}) by the hypothesis that $g$ is homotopic to $f$, so that (\ref{simplicial set inf-cat homotopy is equivalence-1}) is equivalent to the transitivity of the relation of homotopy.\par
It remains to prove (\ref{simplicial set inf-cat homotopy is equivalence-1}). Let $\sigma_2$ and $\sigma_3$ be $2$-simplices of $\mathcal{C}$ which are homotopies from $f$ to $h$ and $f$ to $g$, respectively, and let $\sigma_0$ be the $2$-simplex given by the constant map $\Delta^2\to\Delta^0\stackrel{Y}{\to}\mathcal{C}$. Then the tuple $(\sigma_0,\ast,\sigma_2,\sigma_3)$ determines a map of simplicial sets $\tau_0:\Lambda_1^3\to\mathcal{C}$, depicted informally by the diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=15mm,column sep=15mm]
&Y\ar[r,"\id_Y"]&Y\ar[rd,dashed,"\id_Y"]&\\
X\ar[ru,"f"]\ar[rru,dashed,"g"{anchor=south}]\ar[rrr,dashed,"h"]&&&Y\ar[llu,crossing over,leftarrow,swap,"\id_Y"{anchor=south}]
\end{tikzcd}\]
where the dotted arrows indicate the boundary of the “missing” face of the horn $\Lambda^3_1$. Our hypothesis that $\mathcal{C}$ is an $\infty$-category guarantees that $\tau_0$ can be extended to a $3$-simplex $\tau$ of $\mathcal{C}$. We can then regard the face $d_1(\tau)$ as a homotopy from $g$ to $h$.
\end{proof}
Note that there is a potential asymmetry in the definition of homotopy: if $f,g:X\to Y$ are two morphisms in an $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, then the datum of a homotopy from $f$ to $g$ in the $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ is not equivalent to the datum of a homotopy from $f$ to $g$ in the opposite $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}^{\op}$. Nevertheless, we have the following:
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set inf-cat homotopy symmetric}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category, and let $f,g:X\to Y$ be morphisms of $\mathcal{C}$ having the same source and target. Then $f$ and $g$ are homotopic if and only if they are homotopic when regarded as morphisms of the opposite $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}^{\op}$. In other words, the following conditions are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] There exists a $2$-simplex $\sigma$ of $\mathcal{C}$ satisfying $d_0(\sigma)=\id_Y$, $d_1(\sigma)=g$, and $d_2(\sigma)=f$, as depicted in the diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
&Y\ar[rd,"\id_Y"]&\\
X\ar[ru,"f"]\ar[rr,"g"]&&Y
\end{tikzcd}\] 
\item[(b)] There exists a $2$-simplex $\sigma$ of $\mathcal{C}$ satisfying $d_0(\sigma)=f$, $d_1(\sigma)=g$, and $d_2(\sigma)=\id_X$, as depicted in the diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
&X\ar[rd,"f"]&\\
X\ar[ru,"\id_X"]\ar[rr,"g"]&&Y
\end{tikzcd}\] 
\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
We will show that (a) implies (b); the proof of the reverse implication is similar. Assume that $f$ is homotopic to $g$. Since the relation of homotopy is symmetric (\cref{simplicial set inf-cat homotopy is equivalence}), it follows that $g$ is also homotopic to $f$. Let $\sigma$ be a homotopy from $g$ to $f$. Then we can regard the tuple of $2$-simplices $(\sigma,s_1(g),\ast,s_0(g))$ as a map of simplicial sets $\rho_0:\Lambda^3_2\to\mathcal{C}$, depicted informally in the diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=15mm,column sep=15mm]
&X\ar[r,"g"]&Y\ar[rd,"\id_Y"]&\\
X\ar[ru,dashed,"\id_X"]\ar[rru,"g"{anchor=south}]\ar[rrr,dashed,"g"]&&&Y\ar[llu,crossing over,dashed,leftarrow,swap,"f"{anchor=south}]
\end{tikzcd}\]
Using our assumption that $\mathcal{C}$ is an $\infty$-category, we can extend $\rho_0$ to a $3$-simplex $\rho$ of $\mathcal{C}$. Then the face $\tau=d_2(\rho)$ has the properties required by (b).
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}\label{simplicial set homotopy iff Delta^1 x Delta^1}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category, and let $f,g:X\to Y$ be morphisms of $\mathcal{C}$ having the same source and target. Then $f$ and $g$ are homotopic if and only if there exists a map of simplicial sets $H:\Delta^1\times\Delta^1\to\mathcal{C}$ satisfying
\[H|_{\{0\}\times\Delta^1}=f,\quad H|_{\{1\}\times\Delta^1}=g,\quad H|_{\Delta^1\times\{0\}}=\id_X,\quad H|_{\Delta^1\times\{1\}}=\id_Y\]
as indicated in the diagram
\begin{equation}\label{simplicial set homotopy iff Delta^1 x Delta^1-1}
\begin{tikzcd}
X\ar[dd,swap,"f"]\ar[rrdd,"h"{anchor=south}]\ar[rr,"\id_X"]&{}&X\ar[dd,"g"]\ar[ld,phantom,"\tau"description]\\
&{}&\\
Y\ar[rr,"\id_X"]\ar[ru,phantom,"\sigma"description]&&Y
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
The "only if" direction is clear: if $\sigma$ is a homotopy from $f$ to $g$, then we can extend $\sigma$ to a map $H:\Delta^1\times\Delta^1\to\mathcal{C}$ by taking $\tau$ to be the degenerate simplex $s_0(g)$. Conversely, suppose that there exists a map $H:\Delta^1\times\Delta^1\to\mathcal{C}$, as indicated in the diagram (\ref{simplicial set homotopy iff Delta^1 x Delta^1-1}). Then the $2$-simplex $\sigma$ is a homotopy from $f$ to $h$, and the $2$-simplex $\tau$ guarantees that $g$ is homotopic to $h$ (by virtue of \cref{simplicial set inf-cat homotopy symmetric}). Since homotopy is an equivalence relation (\cref{simplicial set inf-cat homotopy is equivalence}), it follows that $f$ is homotopic to $g$. 
\end{proof}
\subsection{Compositions of morphisms in \texorpdfstring{$\infty$}{inf}-categories}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category. Suppose that we are given objects $X,Y,Z\in\mathcal{C}$ and morphisms $f:X\to Y$, $g:Y\to Z$, and $h:X\to Z$. We say that $h$ is a composition of $f$ and $g$ if there exists a $2$-simplex $\sigma$ of $C$ satisfying $d_0(\sigma)=g$, $d_1(\sigma)=h$, and $d_2(\sigma)=f$, as depicted in the diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
&Y\ar[rd,"g"]&\\
X\ar[ru,"f"]\ar[rr,"h"]&&Z
\end{tikzcd}\]
In this case, we also say that the $2$-simplex $\sigma$ \textbf{witnesses} $h$ as a composition of $f$ and $g$. From condition (Kan'), we see that the morphism $h$ is \textit{not} uniquely determined by $f$ and $g$. However, we shall see that it is determined up to homotopy:
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set inf-cat composition unique up to homotopy}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category containing morphisms $f:X\to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] There exists a morphism $h:X\to Z$ which is a composition of $f$ and $g$.
\item[(b)] Let $h:X\to Z$ be a composition of $f$ and $g$, and let $h':X\to Z$ be another morphism in $\mathcal{C}$ having the same source and target. Then $h'$ is a composition of $f$ and $g$ if and only if $h'$ is homotopic to $h$.
\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The tuple $(g,\ast,f)$ determines a map of simplicial sets $\sigma_0:\Lambda^2_1\to\mathcal{C}$. Since $\mathcal{C}$ is an $\infty$-category, we can extend $\sigma_0$ to a $2$-simplex $\sigma$ of $\mathcal{C}$. Then $\sigma$ witnesses the morphism $h=d_1(\sigma)$ as a composition of $f$ and $g$, so this proves (a). To prove (b), let us first suppose that $h':X\to Z$ is some other morphism in $\mathcal{C}$ which is a composition of $f$ and $g$. Choose a $2$-simplex $\sigma'$ which witnesses $h'$ as a composition of $f$ and $g$. Then the tuple $(s_1(g),\ast,\sigma',\sigma)$ determines a morphism of simplicial sets $\tau_0:\Lambda^3_1\to\mathcal{C}$, which we depict informally as a diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=15mm,column sep=15mm]
&Y\ar[r,"g"]&Z\ar[rd,dashed,"\id_Z"]&\\
X\ar[ru,"f"]\ar[rru,dashed,"h"{anchor=south}]\ar[rrr,dashed,"h'"]&&&Z\ar[llu,crossing over,leftarrow,swap,"g"{anchor=south}]
\end{tikzcd}\]
Using our assumption that $\mathcal{C}$ is an $\infty$-category, we can extend $\tau_0$ to a $3$-simplex $\tau$ of $\mathcal{C}$. Then the face $d_1(\tau)$ is a homotopy from $h$ to $h'$.\par
We now prove the converse. Let $\sigma$ be a $2$-simplex of $\mathcal{C}$ which witnesses $h$ as a composition of $f$ and $g$, and let $h':X\to Z$ be a morphism of $\mathcal{C}$ which is homotopic to $h$. Let $\sigma'$ be a $2$-simplex of $\mathcal{C}$ which is a homotopy from $h$ to $h'$. Then the tuple $(s_1(g),\sigma',\ast,\sigma)$ determines a map of simplicial sets $\rho_0:\Lambda^3_2\to\mathcal{C}$, which we depict informally as a diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=15mm,column sep=15mm]
&Y\ar[r,"g"]&Z\ar[rd,"\id_Z"]&\\
X\ar[ru,dashed,"f"]\ar[rru,"h"{anchor=south}]\ar[rrr,dashed,"h'"]&&&Z\ar[llu,crossing over,leftarrow,dashed,swap,"g"{anchor=south}]
\end{tikzcd}\]
Our assumption that $\mathcal{C}$ is an $\infty$-category guarantees that we can extend $\rho_0$ to a $3$-simplex $\rho$ of $\mathcal{C}$. Then the face $d_2(\rho)$ witnesses $h'$ as a composition of $f$ and $g$.
\end{proof}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category and let $f:X\to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$ be a pair of morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$. We will write $h=g\circ f$ to indicate that $h$ is a composition of $f$ and $g$. In this case, it should be implicitly understood that we have chosen a $2$-simplex that witnesses $h$ as a composition of $f$ and $g$. We sometimes abuse terminology by referring to $h$ as the composition of $f$ and $g$. However, the reader should beware that only the homotopy class of $h$ is well-defined (\cref{simplicial set inf-cat composition unique up to homotopy}).
\begin{example}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an ordinary category containing a pair of morphisms $f:X\to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$. Then there is a unique morphism $h:X\to Z$ in the $\infty$-category $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ which is a composition of $f$ and $g$, given by the usual composition $g\circ f$ in the category $\mathcal{C}$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
Let $X$ be a topological space and suppose we are given continuous paths $f,g:[0,1]\to X$ which are composable in the sense that $f(1)=g(0)$, and let $g\ast f:[0,1]\to X$ denote the path obtained by concatenating $f$ and $g$, given concretely by the formula
\[(g\ast f)(t)=\begin{cases}
f(2t)&\text{if $t\in[0,1/2]$},\\
g(2t-1)&\text{if $t\in[1/2,1]$}.
\end{cases}\]
Then $g\ast f$ is a composition of $f$ and $g$ in the $\infty$-category $\Sing_\bullet(X)$. More precisely, the continuous map $\sigma:|\Delta^2|\to X$ given by
\[\sigma(t_0,t_1,t_2)=\begin{cases}
f(t_1+2t_2)&\text{if $t_0\geq t_2$},\\
g(t_2-t_0)&\text{if $t_0\leq t_2$}.
\end{cases}\]
can be regarded as a $2$-simplex of $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ which witnesses $g\ast f$ as a composition of $f$ and $g$.\par
However, note that the concatenation $g\ast f$ is not the only path which is a composition of $f$ and $g$ in the $\infty$-category $\Sing_\bullet(X)$. Any path in $X$ which is path homotopic to $g\ast f$ has the same property, by virtue of \cref{simplicial set inf-cat composition unique up to homotopy} and \cref{simplicial set Sing(X) homotopy iff path homotopy}. For example, we can replace $g\ast f$ by a reparametrization, such as the path
\[h(s)=\begin{cases}
f(3s)&\text{if $s\in[0,1/3]$},\\
g(\frac{3}{2}s-\frac{1}{2})&\text{if $s\i[1/3,1]$}.
\end{cases}\]
When viewing $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ as an $\infty$-category, all of these paths have an equal claim to be regarded as "the" composition of $f$ and $g$.
\end{example}
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set inf-cat composotion respect homotopy}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category. Suppose we are given a pair of homotopic morphisms $f,f':X\to Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$ and a pair of homotopic morphisms $g,g':Y\to Z$ in $\mathcal{C}$. Let $h$ be a composition of $f$ and $g$, and $h'$ be a composition of $f'$ and $g'$. Then $h$ is homotopic to $h'$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $h''$ be a composition of $f$ and $g'$. Since homotopy is an equivalence relation (\cref{simplicial set inf-cat homotopy is equivalence}), it will suffice to show that both $h$ and $h'$ are homotopic to $h''$. We will show that $h$ is homotopic to $h''$, since the proof that $h'$ is homotopic to $h''$ is similar. Let $\sigma_3$ be a $2$-simplex of $\mathcal{C}$ which witnesses $h$ as a composition of $f$ and $g$, $\sigma_2$ be a $2$-simplex of $\mathcal{C}$ which witnesses $h''$ as a composition of f and $g'$, and let $\sigma_0$ be a $2$-simplex of $\mathcal{C}$ which is a homotopy from $g$ to $g'$. Then the tuple $(\sigma_0,\ast,\sigma_2,\sigma_3)$ determines a map of simplicial sets $\tau_0:\Lambda_1^3\to\mathcal{C}$, which we depict informally as a diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=15mm,column sep=15mm]
&Y\ar[r,"g"]&Z\ar[rd,dashed,"\id_Z"]&\\
X\ar[ru,"f"]\ar[rru,dashed,"h"{anchor=south}]\ar[rrr,dashed,"h''"]&&&Z\ar[llu,crossing over,leftarrow,swap,"g'"{anchor=south}]
\end{tikzcd}\]
Using our assumption that $\mathcal{C}$ is an $\infty$-category, we can extend $\tau_0$ to a $3$-simplex $\tau$ of $\mathcal{C}$. Then the face $d_1(\tau)$ is a homotopy from $h$ to $h''$.
\end{proof}
\subsection{Homotopy category of an \texorpdfstring{$\infty$}{inf}-category}
To any topological space $X$, recall that one can associate a category $\Pi(X)$, called the fundamental groupoid of $X$. This category can be described informally as follows: the objects of $\Pi(X)$ are points of $X$, and given a pair of points $x,y\in X$, $\Hom_{\Pi(X)}(x,y)$ is the set of homotopy classes of continuous paths $p:[0,1]\to X$ satisfying $p(0)=x$ and $p(1)=y$, with composition given by concatenation of paths. All of the concepts needed to define the fundamental groupoid $\Pi(X)$ (such as points, paths, homotopies, and concatenation) can be formulated in terms of singular $n$-simplices of $X$ (for $n\geq 2$). Consequently, one can view the fundamental groupoid $\Pi(X)$ as an invariant of the simplicial set $\Sing_\bullet(X)$, rather than the topological space $X$. In this paragraph, we describe an extension of this invariant, where the simplicial set $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ is replaced by an arbitrary $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$. In this case, the fundamental groupoid $\Pi(X)$ is replaced by a category $h(\mathcal{C})$ which we call the \textbf{homotopy category} of $\mathcal{C}$ (beware that the homotopy category $h\mathcal{C}$ is generally not a groupoid: in fact, we will later see that it is a groupoid if and only if $\mathcal{C}$ is a Kan complex).\par
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category. For every pair of objects $X,Y\in\mathcal{C}$, we let $\Hom_{h(\mathcal{C})}(X,Y)$ denote the set of homotopy classes of morphisms from $X$ to $Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$. For every morphism $f:X\to Y$, we let $[f]$ denote its equivalence class in $\Hom_{h(\mathcal{C})}(X,Y)$. It follows from Propositions~\ref{simplicial set inf-cat composition unique up to homotopy} and \ref{simplicial set inf-cat composotion respect homotopy} that, for every triple of objects $X,Y,Z\in\mathcal{C}$, there is a unique composition law
\begin{align}\label{simplicial set inf-cat composition in homotopy cat}
\circ:\Hom_{h(\mathcal{C})}(Y,Z)\times\Hom_{h(\mathcal{C})}(X,Y)\to\Hom_{h(\mathcal{C})}(X,Z)
\end{align}
satisfying the identity $[g]\circ[f]=[h]$ whenever $h:X\to Z$ is a composition of $f$ and $g$ in the $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$.
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set inf-cat homotopy cat def}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] The composition law (\ref{simplicial set inf-cat composition in homotopy cat}) is associative. That is, for every triple of composable morphisms $f:W\to X$, $g:X\to Y$, and $h:Y\to Z$ in $\mathcal{C}$, we have an equality $([h]\circ[g])\circ[f]=[h]\circ([g]\circ[f])$ in $\Hom_{h(\mathcal{C})}(W,Z)$.
\item[(b)] For every object $X\in\mathcal{C}$, the homotopy class $[\id_X]\in Hom_{h(\mathcal{C})}(X,X)$ is a two-sided identity with respect to the composition law (\ref{simplicial set inf-cat composition in homotopy cat}). That is, for every morphism $f:W\to X$ in $\mathcal{C}$ and every morphism $g:X\to Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$, we have $[\id_X]\circ[f]=[f]$ and $[g]\circ[\id_X]=[g]$.
\end{itemize}
In other word, the composition law (\ref{simplicial set inf-cat composition in homotopy cat}) makes $h(\mathcal{C})$ a category, called the \textbf{homotopy category} of $\mathcal{C}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
We first prove (a). Let $u:W\to Y$ be a composition of $f$ and $g$, let $v:X\to Z$ be a composition of $g$ and $h$, and let $w:W\to Z$ be a composition of $f$ and $v$. Then $([h]\circ[g])\circ[f]=[w]$ and $[h]\circ([g]\circ[f])=[h]\circ[u]$. It therefore suffices to show that $w$ is a composition of $u$ and $h$. Choose a $2$-simplex $\sigma_0$ of $\mathcal{C}$ which witnesses $v$ as a composition of $g$ and $h$, a $2$-simplex $\sigma_0$ of $\mathcal{C}$ which witnesses $w$ as a composition of $f$ and $v$, and a $2$-simplex $\sigma_3$ of $\mathcal{C}$ which witnesses $u$ as a composition of $f$ and $g$. Then the sequence $(\sigma_0,\ast,\sigma_2,\sigma_3)$ determines a map of simplicial sets $\tau_0:\Lambda_1^3\to\mathcal{C}$, which we depict informally as a diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=15mm,column sep=15mm]
&X\ar[r,"g"]&Y\ar[rd,dashed,"h"]&\\
W\ar[ru,"f"]\ar[rru,dashed,"u"{anchor=south}]\ar[rrr,dashed,"w"]&&&Z\ar[llu,crossing over,leftarrow,swap,"v"{anchor=south}]
\end{tikzcd}\]
Using our assumption that $\mathcal{C}$ is an $\infty$-category, we can extend $\tau_0$ to a $3$-simplex $\tau$ of $\mathcal{C}$. Then the $2$-simplex $d_1(\tau)$ witnesses $w$ as a composition of $u$ and $h$.
\end{proof}
\begin{example}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an ordinary category. Then the homotopy category of the $\infty$-category $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ can be identified with $\mathcal{C}$. In particular, for each $n\geq 0$, the homotopy category $h(\Delta^n)$ can be identified with $[n]$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
Let $X$ be a topological space, and regard the singular simplicial set $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ as an $\infty$-category. Then the homotopy category $h(\Sing_\bullet(X))$ can be identified with the fundamental groupoid $\Pi(X)$.
\end{example}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category and let $\sigma:\Delta^n\to\mathcal{C}$ be an $n$-simplex of $\mathcal{C}$. For $0\leq i\leq n$, let $C_i$ denote the object of $\mathcal{C}$ given by the image of the $i$-th vertex of $\Delta^n$. For $0\leq i\leq j\leq n$, let $f_{ij}:C_i\to C_j$ denote the image under $\sigma$ of the edge of $\Delta^n$ joining the $i$-th vertex to the $j$-th vertex, and let $[f_{ij}]\in\Hom_{h(\mathcal{C})}(C_i,C_j)$ denote the homotopy class of $f_{ij}$. Then we can regard $(\{C_i\},\{[f_{ij}]\})$ as a functor from the linearly ordered set $[n]$ to the homotopy category $h(\mathcal{C})$. Let $u(\sigma)$ denote the corresponding $n$-simplex of $N_\bullet(h(\mathcal{C}))$. Then the map $\sigma\mapsto u(\sigma)$ determines a map of simplicial sets
\[u:\mathcal{C}\to N_\bullet(h(\mathcal{C})).\]
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set inf-cat homotopy cat is adjoint}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category and let $u:\mathcal{C}\to N_\bullet(h(\mathcal{C}))$ be the map described above. Then $u$ exhibits $h(\mathcal{C})$ as a homotopy category of the simplicial set $\mathcal{C}$. In other words, for every category $\mathcal{D}$, the composite map
\[\Hom_{\mathbf{Cat}}(h(\mathcal{C}),\mathcal{D})\to\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(N_\bullet(h(\mathcal{C})),N_\bullet(\mathcal{D}))\stackrel{\circ u}{\to}\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\mathcal{C},N_\bullet(\mathcal{D}))\]
is bijective.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $F:\mathcal{C}\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{D})$ be a map of simplicial sets. Then $F$ induces a functor of homotopy categories $G:h(\mathcal{C})\to h(N_\bullet(D))\cong\mathcal{D}$. By construction, the map of simplicial sets
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\mathcal{C}\ar[r,"u"]&N_\bullet(h(\mathcal{C}))\ar[r,"N_\bullet(G)"]&N_\bullet(\mathcal{D})
\end{tikzcd}\]
agrees with $F$ on the vertices and edges of $\mathcal{C}$, and therefore coincides with $F$ (since a simplex of $N_\bullet(\mathcal{D})$ is determined by its $1$-dimensional facets). On the other hand, since any functor from $h(\mathcal{C})$ to $\mathcal{D}$ is comcpletely determined by its action on vertices and facets, we see $G$ is the unique functor satisfying this property. 
\end{proof}
\subsection{Isomorphisms in \texorpdfstring{$\infty$}{inf}-categories}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category and let $f:X\to Y$ be a morphism of $\mathcal{C}$. We say that $f$ is an \textbf{isomorphism} if the homotopy class $[f]$ is an isomorphism in the homotopy category $h(\mathcal{C})$. We say that two objects $X,Y\in\mathcal{C}$ are isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism from $X$ to $Y$ (that is, if $X$ and $Y$ are isomorphic as objects of the homotopy category $h(\mathcal{C})$). It is clear that if $\mathcal{C}$ be an ordinary category, then a morphism $f:X\to Y$ of $\mathcal{C}$ is an isomorphism if and only if it is an isomorphism when regarded as a morphism of the $\infty$-category $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$, so this notion generalize the usual isomorphisms in categories.\par
Now suppose that we are given a pair of morphisms $f:X\to Y$ and $g:Y\to X$ in an $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$. We say that $g$ is a \textbf{left homotopy inverse} of $f$ if the identity morphism $\id_X$ is a composition of $f$ and $g$: that is, if we have an equality $[\id_X]=[g]\circ[f]$ in the homotopy category $h(\mathcal{C})$. Similarly, $g$ is a \textbf{right homotopy inverse} of $f$ if the identity morphism $\id_Y$ is a composition of $g$ and $f$: that is, if we have an equality $[\id_Y]=[f]\circ[g]$ in the homotopy category $h(\mathcal{C})$. We say that $g$ is a \textbf{homotopy inverse} of $f$ if it is both a left and a right homotopy inverse of $f$. We note that the condition that $g$ is left homotopy inverse to $f$ is equivalent to that $f$ is right homotopy inverse to $g$, since both of these conditions are equivalent to the existence of a $2$-simplex $\sigma$ of $\mathcal{C}$ satisfying $d_0(\sigma)=g$, $d_1(\sigma)=\id_X$, and $d_2(\sigma)=f$, as depicted in the diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
&Y\ar[rd,"g"]&\\
X\ar[ru,"f"]\ar[rr,"\id_X"]&&X
\end{tikzcd}\]

On the other hand, suppose that a morphism $f:X\to Y$ admits a left homotopy inverse $g$ and a right homotopy inverse $h$. Then $g$ and $h$ are homotopic: we have
\[[g]=[g]\circ[\id_Y]=[g]\circ([f]\circ[h])=([g]\circ[f])\circ[h]=[\id_Y]\circ[h]=[h].\]
In particular, for a morphism $f:X\to Y$ in an $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, we see that the following are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(\rmnum{1})] The morphism $f$ is an isomorphism.
\item[(\rmnum{2})] The morphism $f$ admits a homotopy inverse $g$.
\item[(\rmnum{3})] The morphism $f$ admits both left and right homotopy inverses.
\end{itemize}
In this case, the morphism $g$ is uniquely determined up to homotopy; moreover, any left or right homotopy inverse of $f$ is homotopic to $g$. We will sometimes abuse notation by writing $f^{-1}$ to denote a homotopy inverse to $f$.
\begin{remark}
Let $f:X\to Y$ be a morphism in an $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, and suppose that $g,h:Y\to X$ are left homotopy inverses to $f$. If $f$ does not admit a right homotopy inverse, then $g$ and $h$ need not be homotopic. This follows from the fact that a left-invertible morphism is not necessarily invertible.
\end{remark}
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set Kan morphism is isomorphism}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a Kan complex. Then every morphisms of $\mathcal{C}$ is an isomorphism. In other words, its homotopy category $h(\mathcal{C})$ is a groupoid.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $f:X\to Y$ be a morphism in $\mathcal{C}$. Then the tuple $(\ast,\id_X,f)$ determines a map of simplicial sets $\sigma_0:\Lambda^2_0\to\mathcal{C}$, which we depict as
\[\begin{tikzcd}
&Y\ar[rd]&\\
X\ar[ru,"f"]\ar[rr,"\id_X"]&&X
\end{tikzcd}\]
If $\mathcal{C}$ is a Kan complex, then we can extend $\sigma_0$ to a $2$-simplex $\sigma$ of $\mathcal{C}$. Then $\sigma$ exhibits the morphism $g=d_0(\sigma)$ as a left homotopy inverse to $f$. A similar argument shows that $f$ admits a right homotopy inverse, so that $f$ is an isomorphism.
\end{proof}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a Kan complex, then it follows from \cref{simplicial set Kan morphism is isomorphism} that the homotopy category $h(S_\bullet)$ is a groupoid. We denote this groupoid by $\Pi(S_\bullet)$ and call it as the \textbf{fundamental groupoid} of $S_\bullet$.
\begin{remark}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a Kan complex. By definition, the objects of the fundamental groupoid $\Pi(S_\bullet)$ are the vertices of $S_\bullet$, and a pair of vertices $x,y\in S_0$ are isomorphic in $\Pi(S_\bullet)$ if and only if there exists an edge $e:x\to y$ in $S_\bullet$. Applying \cref{simplicial set Kan same component iff connected by edge}, we deduce that $x,y\in S_0$ are isomorphic if and only if they belong to the same connected component of $S_\bullet$. In other words, we have a canonical bijection
\[\pi_0(S_\bullet)\cong\Ob(\Pi(S_\bullet))/\text{isomorphism}.\]
\end{remark}
\begin{example}
Let $X$ be a topological space. Then the singular simplicial set $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ is a Kan complex (\cref{simplicial set singular is Kan}), and its fundamental groupoid $\Pi(\Sing_\bullet(X))$ can be identified with the usual fundamental groupoid $\Pi(X)$ of the topological space $X$ (where objects are the points of $X$ and morphisms are given by homotopy classes of paths in $X$).
\end{example}
\section{Functor of \texorpdfstring{$\infty$}{inf}-categories}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ be categories and $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ and $N_\bullet(\mathcal{D})$ denote the corresponding $\infty$-categories. According to \cref{simplicial set nerve of cat fully faithful}, the nerve functor $N_\bullet$ induces a bijection
\[\Hom_{\mathbf{Cat}}(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})\stackrel{\sim}{\to}\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(N_\bullet(\mathcal{D}),N_\bullet(\mathcal{D})).\]
Consequently, the notion of functor admits an obvious generalization to the setting of $\infty$-categories: if $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ are $\infty$-categories, a functor $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{D}$ is defined to be a map of simplicial sets $F:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$. This section is devoted to the study of functors between $\infty$-categories.
\subsection{Example of functors}
Let $F:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$ be a functor of $\infty$-categories. Then $F$ carries objects of $\mathcal{D}$ to that of $\mathcal{D}$, and edges of $\mathcal{C}$ to that of $\mathcal{D}$. Also, $F$ is compatible with composition "up to coherent homotopy." For example, suppose that we are given objects $X,Y,Z\in\mathcal{C}$ and morphisms $f:X\to Y$, $g:Y\to Z$, and $h:X\to Z$. If $h$ is a composition of $f$ and $g$, then $F(h)$ is a composition of $F(f)$ and $F(g)$. Moreover, we can say more: if $\sigma$ is a $2$-simplex of $\mathcal{C}$ which witnesses $h$ as a composition of $f$ and $g$, then $F(\sigma)$ is a $2$-simplex of $\mathcal{D}$ which witnesses $F(h)$ as a composition of $F(f)$ and $F(g)$. In particular, we see that $f,g:X\to Y$ are homotopic morphisms of $\mathcal{C}$, then $F(f),F(g):F(X)\to F(Y)$ are homotopic morphisms of $\mathcal{D}$. More precisely, the functor $F$ carries homotopies from $f$ to $g$ (viewed as $2$-simplices of $\mathcal{C}$) to homotopies from $F(f)$ to $F(g)$ (viewed as $2$-simplices of $\mathcal{D}$).
\begin{example}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category and let $\mathcal{D}$ be an ordinary category. Using \cref{simplicial set inf-cat homotopy cat is adjoint}, we obtain a bijection from functors of $\infty$-categories from $\mathcal{C}$ to $N_\bullet(\mathcal{D})$ to that of ordinary categories from $h(\mathcal{C})$ to $\mathcal{D}$
\end{example}
\begin{example}
Let $X$ be a topological space and let $\mathcal{C}$ be an ordinary category. To specify a functor of $\infty$-categories $F:\Sing_\bullet(X)\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$, one must give a rule which assigns to each continuous map $\sigma:|\Delta^n|\to X$ (viewed as an $n$-simplex of $\Sing_\bullet(X)$) a diagram $F(\sigma)$ of morphisms in $\mathcal{D}$. In particular:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] To each point $x\in X$, the functor $F$ assigns an object $F(x)\in\mathcal{C}$.
\item[(b)] To each continuous path $f:[0,1]\to X$ starting at the point $x=f(0)$ and ending at the point $y=f(1)$, the functor $F$ assigns a morphism $F(f):F(x)\to F(y)$ in the category $\mathcal{C}$. The morphism $F(f)$ is automatically an isomorphism by \cref{simplicial set nerve of cat Kan iff groupoid}.
\item[(c)] For each continuous map $\sigma:|\Delta^2|\to X$ with boundary behavior as depicted in the diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
&y\ar[rd,"g"]&\\
x\ar[ru,"f"]\ar[rr,"h"]&&z
\end{tikzcd}\]
we have an identity $F(h)=F(g)\circ F(f)$ in $\Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(F(x),F(z))$.
\end{itemize}
The data of a collection of objects $\{F(x)\}_{x\in X}$ and isomorphisms $\{F(f)\}_{f:[0,1]\to X}$ satisfying (c) is called a \textbf{$\bm{\mathcal{C}}$-valued local system} on $X$. Theerfore the preceding discussion determines a bijection between functors from $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ to $N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ and $\mathcal{C}$-valued local system on $X$. By virtue of \cref{simplicial set Sing(X) homotopy cat is Pi(X)}, we can also identify local systems with functors from the fundamental groupoid $\Pi(X)$ into $\mathcal{C}$.\par
More generally, for an arbitrary $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, we can define a $\mathcal{C}$-valued local system on $X$ to be a functor of $\infty$-categories $\Sing_\bullet(X)\to\mathcal{C}$. But note that this notion generally cannot be reformulated in terms of the fundamental groupoid $\Pi(X)$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category and let $X$ be a topological space. Then we have a canonical bijection between functors of $\infty$-categories from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\Sing_\bullet(X)$ to continuous functions from $|\mathcal{C}|\to X$, where $|\mathcal{C}|$ denotes the geometric realization of the simplicial set $\mathcal{C}$. Beware that neither side has an obvious interpretation in terms of functors between ordinary categories (even in the special case where $\mathcal{C}$ is the nerve of a category).
\end{example}
\subsection{Commutative diagrams in \texorpdfstring{$\infty$}{inf}-categories}
In ordinary category theory, one can think of a functor $F:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$ as a kind of commutative diagram in $\mathcal{D}$, having vertices indexed by the objects of $\mathcal{C}$ and arrows indexed by the morphisms of $\mathcal{C}$. This perspective is quite useful: if the category $\mathcal{C}$ is sufficiently small, one can communicate the datum of a functor by drawing a graphical representation of the corresponding diagram. In this paragraph, we discuss the generalization of this notion in an $\infty$-category.\par
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category. A \textbf{diagram} in $\mathcal{C}$ is defined to be a map of simplicial sets $f:K_\bullet\to\mathcal{C}$ (or a \textbf{diagram in $\mathcal{C}$ indexed by $K_\bullet$}, or a $K_\bullet$-indexed diagram). If $K_\bullet$ is the nerve $N_\bullet(I)$ of a partially ordered set $I$, we also say that this is a diagram in $\mathcal{C}$ indexed by $I$, or an $I$-indexed diagram in $\mathcal{C}$.
\begin{example}\label{simplicial set diagram indexed by graph}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category and let $K_\bullet$ be a simplicial set of dimension $\leq 1$, corresponding to a directed graph $G$. In this case, a diagram $K_\bullet\to\mathcal{C}$ can be identified with a pair $(\{C_v\}_{v\in V(G)},\{f_e\}_{e\in E(G)})$, where each $C_v$ is an object of the $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ and each $f_e:C_{s(e)}\to C_{t(e)}$ is a morphism of $C$ (here $s(e)$ and $t(e)$ denote the source and target of the edge $e$). It is often convenient to specify diagrams $K_\bullet\to\mathcal{C}$ by drawing a graphical representation of $G$, where each node is labelled by an object of $\mathcal{C}$ and each arrow is labelled by a morphism in $\mathcal{C}$ (having the indicated source and target).
\end{example}
\begin{example}[\textbf{Noncommutative Squares in Categories}]\label{simplicial set non-commutative square in cat}
Let $K_\bullet$ denote the boundary of the product $\Delta^1\times\Delta^1$: that is, the simplicial subset of $\Delta^1\times\Delta^1$ given by the union of the simplicial subsets $\partial\Delta^1\times\Delta^1$ and $\Delta^1\times\partial\Delta^1$. Then $K_\bullet$ is a $1$-dimensional simplicial set, corresponding to a directed graph which we can depict as
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\bullet\ar[r]\ar[d]&\bullet\ar[d]\\
\bullet\ar[r]&\bullet
\end{tikzcd}\]
We can then display a $K_\bullet$-indexed diagram in an $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ pictorially
\[\begin{tikzcd}
C_{00}\ar[d,swap,"g"]\ar[r,"f"]&C_{01}\ar[d,"g'"]\\
C_{10}\ar[r,"f'"]&C_{11}
\end{tikzcd}\]
where each $C_{ij}$ is an object of $\mathcal{C}$. Note that this square does not necessarily commute.
\end{example}
In classical category theory, it is useful to extend the notational of \cref{simplicial set diagram indexed by graph} to more general situations by introducing the notion of a \textit{commutative diagram}. Let $K_\bullet$ be a simplicial set of dimension $\leq 1$, which we will identify with a directed graph $G$. Assume that $G$ is a \textbf{simple graph}; that is, $G$ satisfies the following additional conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] For every pair of vertices $v,w\in V(G)$, there is at most one edge of $G$ with source $v$ and target $w$. We will denote this edge (if it exists) by $(v,w)\in E(G)$.
\item[(b)] The graph $G$ has no directed cycles. That is, if there is a sequence $v_0,v_1,\dots,v_n\in V(G)$ with the property that the edges $(v_{i-1},v_i)$ exist for $1\leq i\leq n$, then either $n=0$ or $v_0\neq v_n$.
\end{itemize}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an ordinary category and suppose we are given a diagram $\sigma:K_\bullet\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$, which we identify with a pair $(\{C_v\}_{v\in V(G)},\{f_e\}_{e\in E(G)})$. We say that the diagram $\sigma$ \textbf{commutes} (or that $\sigma$ is a \textbf{commutative diagram}) if the following additional condition is satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(c)] Let $v$ and $w$ be vertices of $G$ which are joined by directed paths $(v=v_0,v_1,\dots,v_m=w)$ and $(v=w_0,w_1,\dots,w_n=w)$. Then we have an identity
\[f_{v_m,v_{m-1}}\circ f_{v_{m-1},v_{m-2}}\circ\cdots\circ f_{v_1,v_0}=f_{w_n,w_{n-1}}\circ f_{w_{n-1},w_{n-2}}\circ\cdots\circ f_{w_1,w_0}\]
in the set $\Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(C_v,C_w)$.
\end{itemize}
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set diagram commutes iff extend to functor}
Let $K_\bullet$ be a simplicial set of dimension $\leq 1$, corresponding to a directed simple graph $G$. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an ordinary category, and $f:K_\bullet\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ be a diagram. Then:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(\rmnum{1})] There is a partial ordering $\preceq$ on the vertex set $V(G)$, where we have $v\preceq w$ if and only if there exists a sequence of vertices $(v=v_0,v_1,\dots,v_n=w)$ with the property that the edges $(v_{i-1},v_i)\in E(G)$ exist for $1\leq i\leq n$.
\item[(\rmnum{2})] There is a unique monomorphism of simplicial sets $K_\bullet\hookrightarrow N_\bullet(V(G))$ which carries each vertex to itself.
\item[(\rmnum{3})] The diagram $\sigma$ extends to a map $\bar{\sigma}:N_\bullet(V(G))\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ (that is, to a functor $V(G)\to\mathcal{C})$ if and only if it is commutative (here $N_\bullet(V(G))$ is the nerve of the partially ordered set $V(G)$). Moreover, if the extension $\bar{\sigma}$ exists, then it is unique.
\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
It follows immediately from the definitions that the relation $\preceq$ defined in (\rmnum{1}) is reflexive and transitive. Antisymmetry follows from our assumption that the graph $G$ has no directed loops. By construction, we have $v\preceq w$ whenever $v$ and $w$ are connected by an edge $(v,w)\in E(G)$. From the description of the simplicial set $K_\bullet$ given in \cref{simplicial set graph functor description}, we immediately see that there is a unique map of simplicial sets $i:K_\bullet\hookrightarrow N_\bullet(V(G))$ which is the identity on vertices. It follows from assumption (a) that the map $i$ is a monomorphism. Let us henceforth identify $K_\bullet$ with a simplicial subset of $N_\bullet(V(G))$ given by the image of $i$, and identify $\sigma$ with a pair $(\{C_v\}_{v\in V(G)},\{f_e\}_{e\in E(G)})$. Suppose that the diagram $\sigma$ extends to a functor $\bar{\sigma}:N_\bullet(V(G))\to\mathcal{C}$. If $v$ and $w$ are a pair of vertices of $G$ with $v\preceq w$, then we can choose a directed path $(v=v_0,v_1,\dots,v_n=w)$ from $v$ to $w$. The compatibility of $\bar{\sigma}$ with composition then guarantees that $\bar{\sigma}$ must carry the edge $(v,w)$ of $N_\bullet(V(G))$ to the iterated composition $f_{v_n,v_{n-1}}\circ f_{v_{n-1},v_{n-2}}\circ\cdots\circ f_{v_1,v_0}\in\Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(C_v,C_w)$. Since the morphism $\bar{\sigma}(v,w)$ is independent of the choice of directed path, it follows that the diagram $\sigma$ is commutative. Conversely, if $\bar{\sigma}$ is commutative, then we can define $\bar{\sigma}$ on morphisms by the formula $\bar{\sigma}(v,w)=f_{v_n,v_{n-1}}\circ f_{v_{n-1},v_{n-2}}\circ\cdots\circ f_{v_1,v_0}$ to obtain the desired extension of $\sigma$.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
In the situation of \cref{simplicial set diagram commutes iff extend to functor}, an arbitrary map of simplicial sets $\sigma:K_\bullet\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ can be identified with a functor $F:P[G]\to\mathcal{C}$, where $P[G]$ denotes the path category of the graph $G$ (\cref{simplicial set graph homotopy cat is path cat}). The commutativity of the diagram $\sigma$ is equivalent to the requirement that $F$ factors through the quotient functor $P[G]\twoheadrightarrow V(G)$: that is, the value of the functor $F$ on a path depends only the endpoints of that path.
\end{remark}
\begin{example}[\textbf{Commutative Squares in Categories}]\label{simplicial set commutative square in cat}
Let $K_\bullet=\partial(\Delta^1\times\Delta^1)$ be as in \cref{simplicial set non-commutative square in cat}. For any ordinary category $\mathcal{C}$, we can display a diagram $\sigma:K_\bullet\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$ pictorially as
\[\begin{tikzcd}
C_{00}\ar[r,"f"]\ar[d,swap,"g"]&C_{01}\ar[d,"g'"]\\
C_{10}\ar[r,"f'"]&C_{11}
\end{tikzcd}\]
The diagram $\sigma$ is commutative if and only if we have $g'\circ f=f'\circ g$. In this case, \cref{simplicial set diagram commutes iff extend to functor} ensures that $\sigma$ extends uniquely to a diagram $\bar{\sigma}:\Delta^1\times\Delta^1\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$, or equivalently to a functor of ordinary categories $[1]\times[1]\to\mathcal{C}$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}[\textbf{Squares in $\infty$-Categories}]\label{simplicial set inf-cat square diagram}
In the setting of $\infty$-categories, assertion (\rmnum{3}) of \cref{simplicial set diagram commutes iff extend to functor} is false in general. For example, let $I$ denote the partially ordered set $[1]\times[1]$. The simplicial set $N_\bullet(I)\cong\Delta^1\times\Delta^1$ has four vertices (given by the elements of $I$), five nondegenerate edges, and two nondegenerate $2$-simplices. Unwinding the definitions, we see that an $I$-indexed diagram in an $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ is equivalent to the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item A collection of objects $C_{00},C_{01},C_{10},C_{11}$ of $\mathcal{C}$.
\item A collection of morphisms $f:C_{00}\to C_{01}$, $g:C_{00}\to C_{10}$, $f':C_{10}\to C_{11}$, $g':C_{01}\to C_{11}$, and $h:C_{00}\to C_{11}$.
\item A $2$-simplex $\sigma$ of $\mathcal{C}$ which witnesses $h$ as a composition of $f$ with $g'$, and a 2-simplex $\tau$ of $\mathcal{C}$ which witnesses $h$ as a composition of $g$ with $f'$.
\end{itemize}
This data can be depicted graphically as follows:
\[\begin{tikzcd}
C_{00}\ar[dd,swap,"g"]\ar[rrdd,"h"{anchor=south}]\ar[rr,"f"]&{}&C_{01}\ar[dd,"g'"]\ar[ld,phantom,"\sigma"description]\\
&{}&\\
C_{10}\ar[rr,"f'"]\ar[ru,phantom,"\tau"description]&&C_{11}
\end{tikzcd}\]
Such a diagram is usually not determined by its restriction to the simplicial subset $K_\bullet\sub N_\bullet(I)$ of \cref{simplicial set commutative square in cat}, since homotopies bwtween morphisms are not unique in general.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category and $K_\bullet\sub\Delta^1\times\Delta^1$ be the simplicial subset in \cref{simplicial set commutative square in cat}. Suppose that we are given a diagram $\sigma:K_\bullet\to\mathcal{C}$, which we depict graphically as
\[\begin{tikzcd}
C_{00}\ar[r,"f"]\ar[d,swap,"g"]&C_{01}\ar[d,"g'"]\\
C_{10}\ar[r,"f'"]&C_{11}
\end{tikzcd}\]
Composing with the unit map $\mathcal{C}\to N_\bullet(h(\mathcal{C}))$, we obtain a diagram $\sigma'$ in the homotopy category $h(\mathcal{C})$, which we can depict as
\[\begin{tikzcd}
C_{00}\ar[r,"{[f]}"]\ar[d,swap,"{[g]}"]&C_{01}\ar[d,"{[g']}"]\\
C_{10}\ar[r,"{[f']}"]&C_{11}
\end{tikzcd}\]
By definition, the diagram $\sigma'$ is commutative if and only if $[f]\circ[g']=[f']\circ[g]$; that is, if and only if $\sigma$ can be extended to a map $\bar{\sigma}:\Delta^1\times\Delta^1\to\mathcal{C}$ (\cref{simplicial set homotopy iff Delta^1 x Delta^1}). Again, this extension of $\sigma$ is generally not unique.
\end{example}
\cref{simplicial set inf-cat square diagram} illustrates that the notion of "commutative diagram" becomes considerably more subtle in the setting of $\infty$-categories. To specify an $I$-indexed diagram $F:N_\bullet(I)\to\mathcal{C}$ of an $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, one generally needs to specify the values of $F$ on all the simplices of the simplicial set $N_\bullet(I)$. In general, it is not feasible to graphically encode all of this data in a comprehensible way. On the other hand, the formalism of commutative diagrams is too useful to completely abandon. We will therefore sacrifice some degree of mathematical precision in favor of clarity of exposition.\par
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category and let $G$ be a directed simple graph, so that the vertex set $V(G)$ inherits a partial ordering (\cref{simplicial set diagram commutes iff extend to functor}). By a commutative diagram $\sigma$ in $\mathcal{C}$, we mean graphically by a collection of objects $\{C_v\}_{v\in V(G)}$ of $\mathcal{C}$, connected by arrows which are labelled by morphisms $\{f_e\}_{e\in E(G)}$. In this case, it should be understood that $\sigma$ is a diagram $N_\bullet(V(G))\to\mathcal{C}$, which carries each vertex $v$ of $N_\bullet(V(G))$ to the object $C_v\in\mathcal{C}$ and each edge $e=(v,w)$ of $G$ to the morphism $f_e$ in $\mathcal{C}$. Note that in this case, the map $\sigma$ need not be completely determined by the pair $(\{C_v\}_{v\in V(G)},\{f_e\}_{e\in E(G)})$ (this pair can instead be identified with the restriction $\sigma|_{K_\bullet}$, where $K_\bullet$ is the $1$-dimensional simplicial subset of $N_\bullet(V(G))$ corresponding to $G$).
\begin{remark}
Suppose that $\mathcal{C}=N_\bullet(\mathcal{C}_0)$, where $\mathcal{C}_0$ is an ordinary category. Then giving a commutative diagram in the $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ is equivalent to giving a commutative diagram in the ordinary category $\mathcal{C}_0$. In this case, commutativity is a \textit{property} that the underlying diagram (indexed by a $\infty$-dimensional simplicial set) does or does not possess. For a general $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, commutativity of a diagram in $\mathcal{C}$ is not a property but a structure; to promote a diagram to a commutative diagram, one must specify additional data to witness the requisite commutativity.
\end{remark}
\begin{example}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category. Then a commutative diagram $\sigma$ is by definition a $2$-simplex of $\mathcal{C}$ satisfying $d_0(\sigma)=g$, $d_1(\sigma)=h$, and $d_2(\sigma)=f$, as depicted as follows:
\[\begin{tikzcd}
&Y\ar[rd,"g"]&\\
X\ar[ru,"f"]\ar[rr,"h"]&&Z
\end{tikzcd}\]
In other words, we mean that $h$ is a $2$-simplex which witnesses $h$ as a composition of $f$ and $g$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category. Then by a commutative diagram $\sigma$:
\[\begin{tikzcd}
C_{00}\ar[r,"f"]\ar[d,swap,"g"]&C_{01}\ar[d,"g'"]\\
C_{10}\ar[r,"f'"]&C_{11}
\end{tikzcd}\]
we implicitly assume that $\sigma$ is a map from the entire simplicial set $\Delta^1\times\Delta^1$ to $\mathcal{C}$. In other words, we assume that we have specified another morphism $h:C_{00}\to C_{11}$, which is not indicated in the picture, together with a $2$-simplex $\sigma$ witnessing $h$ as the composition of $f$ and $g'$ and a $2$-simplex $\tau$ witnessing $h$ as the composition of $g$ and $f'$.
\end{example}
\begin{remark}
In ordinary category theory, it is sometimes useful to consider commutativity of diagrams in situations which do not fit the paradigm of our definition. For example, the commutativity of a diagram 
\[\begin{tikzcd}
X\ar[r,"f"]&Y\ar[r,shift left=1mm,"u"]\ar[r,shift right=1mm,swap,"v"]&Z
\end{tikzcd}\]
is often understood as the requirement that $u\circ f=v\circ f$. Beware that this usage is potentially ambiguous (from the shape of the diagram alone, it is not clear that commutativity should
enforce the identity $u\circ f=v\circ f$, but not the identity $u=v$), so we will take special care when applying similar terminology in the $\infty$-categorical setting.
\end{remark}
\subsection{The \texorpdfstring{$\infty$}{inf}-category of functors}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ be categories. Then we can form a new category $\Fun(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})$, whose objects are functors from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{D}$ and whose morphisms are natural transformations. We now describe an analogous construction in the setting of $\infty$-categories.\par
Let $S_\bullet$ and $T_\bullet$ be simplicial sets. Then the construction
\[([n]\in\Delta^{\op})\mapsto\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Delta^n\times S_\bullet,T_\bullet)\]
determines a functor from the category $\Delta^{\op}$ to the category of sets. We regard this functor as a simplicial set, which we denote by $\Fun(S_\bullet,T_\bullet)$.\par
Note that, given an $n$-simplex $f$ of $\Fun(S_\bullet,T_\bullet)$ and an $n$-simplex $\sigma$ of $S_\bullet$, we can construct an $n$-simplex $\ev(f,\sigma)$ of $T_\bullet$, given by the composition
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\Delta^n\ar[r]&\Delta^n\times\Delta^n\ar[r,"\id\times\sigma"]&\Delta^n\times S_\bullet\ar[r,"f"]&T_\bullet
\end{tikzcd}\]
where $\Delta^n\to\Delta^n\times\Delta^n$ is the diagonal map. This determines a map of simplicial sets $\ev:\Fun(S_\bullet,T_\bullet)\times S_\bullet\to T_\bullet$, which is called the \textbf{evaluation map}.
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set Fun evaluation map adjoint prop}
Let $S_\bullet$, $T_\bullet$ and $U_\bullet$ be simplicial sets. Then the composite map
\[\theta:\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(U_\bullet,\Fun(S_\bullet,T_\bullet))\to\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(U_\bullet\times S_\bullet,\Fun(S_\bullet,T_\bullet)\times S_\bullet)\stackrel{\ev\circ}{\to}\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(U_\bullet\times S_\bullet,T_\bullet)\]
is bijective.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $f:U_\bullet\times S_\bullet\to T_\bullet$ be a map of simplicial sets. For each $n$-simplex $\sigma$ of $U_\bullet$, the composite map
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\Delta^n\times S_\bullet\ar[r,"\sigma\times\id"]&U_\bullet\times S_\bullet\ar[r,"f"]&T_\bullet
\end{tikzcd}\]
can be regarded as an $n$-simplex of $\Fun(S_\bullet,T_\bullet)$, which we will denote by $g(\sigma)$. The construction $\sigma\mapsto g(\sigma)$ determines a map of simplicial sets $g:U_\bullet\to\Fun(S_\bullet,T_\bullet)$. By the definition of $\theta$, for any $n$-simplex $(\sigma,\tau)$ of $U_\bullet\times S_\bullet$ (where $\sigma:\Delta^n\to U_\bullet$ and $\tau:\Delta^n\to S_\bullet$), the map $\theta(g)$ sends $(\sigma,\tau)$ to $\ev(g(\sigma),\tau)$, which is given by the composition 
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\Delta^n\to\Delta^n\times\Delta^n\ar[r,"\id\times\tau"]&\Delta^n\times S_\bullet\ar[r,"\sigma\times\id"]&U_\bullet\times S_\bullet\ar[r,"f"]&T_\bullet.
\end{tikzcd}\]
which is equal to $f(\sigma,\tau)$, so $\theta(g)=f$. On the other hand, if $g':U_\bullet\to\Fun(S_\bullet,T_\bullet)$ is another map satisfying $\theta(g')=f$, then for any $n$-simplex $(\sigma,\tau)$ of $U_\bullet\times S_\bullet$, the $n$-simplex $f(\sigma,\tau)$ of $T_\bullet$ is given by the composition
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\Delta^n\ar[r]&\Delta^n\times\Delta^n\ar[r,"1\times\tau"]&\Delta^n\times S_\bullet\ar[r,"g'(\sigma)"]&T_\bullet
\end{tikzcd}\]
It then follows that $g(\sigma)=g'(\sigma)$ for any $n$-simplex $\sigma:\Delta^n\to U_\bullet$, so the map $g$ is uniquely determined by $f$.
\end{proof}
One may wonder why we use the notation $\Fun(S_\bullet,T_\bullet)$ to denote a simplicial set in $\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$, rather than a category of functors. This usage is in fact justified by the following proposition:
\begin{proposition}\label{simplicial set functor of nerve cat isomorphism}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ be categories and let $\ev:\Fun(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})\to\mathcal{D}$ denote the evaluation functor, given on objects by the formula $\ev(F,C)=F(C)$. Then the composite map
\[N_\bullet(\Fun(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D}))\times N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})\cong N_\bullet(\Fun(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})\times\mathcal{C})\stackrel{N_\bullet(\ev)}{\to}N_\bullet(\mathcal{D})\]
corresponds, under the bijection of \cref{simplicial set Fun evaluation map adjoint prop}, to an isomorphism of simplicial sets
\[\rho:N_\bullet(\Fun(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D}))\to\Fun(N_\bullet(\mathcal{C}),N_\bullet(\mathcal{D})).\]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
For each positive integer $n\geq 0$, the map $\rho$ sends an $n$-simplex $\sigma:\Delta^n\to N_\bullet(\Fun(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D}))$ to the composition
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\Delta^n\times N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})\ar[r,"\sigma\times\id"]&N_\bullet(\Fun(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D}))\times N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})\ar[r,"\sim"]&N_\bullet(\Fun(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})\times\mathcal{C})\ar[r,"N_\bullet(\ev)"]&N_\bullet(\mathcal{D}).
\end{tikzcd}\]
By \cref{simplicial set nerve of cat fully faithful}, we see that
\begin{gather*}
\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Delta^n,N_\bullet(\Fun(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})))\cong\Hom_{\mathbf{Cat}}([n],\Fun(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D}))\cong\Hom_{\mathbf{Cat}}([n]\times\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D}),\\
\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Delta^n,\Fun(N_\bullet(\mathcal{C}),N_\bullet(\mathcal{D})))\cong\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Delta^n\times N_\bullet(\mathcal{C}),N_\bullet(\mathcal{D})),
\end{gather*}
so $\rho$ corresponds to the followng map
\begin{align*}
&\Hom_{\mathbf{Cat}}([n]\times\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})\stackrel{\gamma}{\to}\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(N_\bullet([n]\times\mathcal{C}),N_\bullet(\mathcal{D}))\cong\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(\Delta^n\times N_\bullet(\mathcal{C}),N_\bullet(\mathcal{D}))
\end{align*}
We know that $\gamma$ is an isomorphism (\cref{simplicial set nerve of cat fully faithful}), so the claim follows.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}\label{simplicial set homotopy cat Fun of nerve isomorphism}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ be categories. Then there is a canonical isomorphism of categories
\[\Fun(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})\cong h\big(\Fun(N_\bullet(\mathcal{C}),N_\bullet(\mathcal{D}))\big).\]
\end{corollary}
\begin{corollary}\label{simplicial set Fun to nerve isomorphism}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set having homotopy category $h(S_\bullet)$. Then, for any category $\mathcal{D}$, the composite map
\[N_\bullet(\Fun(h(S_\bullet),\mathcal{D}))\times S_\bullet\cong N_\bullet(\Fun(h(S_\bullet),\mathcal{D})\times h(S_\bullet))\to N_\bullet(\mathcal{D})\]
induces an isomorphism of simplicial sets $\rho_{S_\bullet}:N_\bullet(\Fun(h(S_\bullet),\mathcal{D}))\cong\Fun(S_\bullet,N_\bullet(\mathcal{D}))$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
The construction $S_\bullet\mapsto\rho_{S_\bullet}$ carries colimits (in the category $\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$ of simplicial sets) to limits (in the category $\Fun([1],\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$) of morphisms between simplicial sets). Since the category $\mathbf{Set}_\Delta$ is generated under colimits by objects of the form $\Delta^n$, it suffices to prove \cref{simplicial set Fun to nerve isomorphism} in the special case where $S_\bullet=\Delta^n$. In this case, the desired result follows from \cref{simplicial set functor of nerve cat isomorphism}, since $S_\bullet$ is isomorphic to the nerve of the category $\mathcal{C}=[n]$.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}\label{simplicial set homotopy cat functor finite product}
The formation of homotopy categories determines a functor $\mathbf{Set}_\Delta\to\mathbf{Cat}$ which commutes with finite products.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Since the construction $S_\bullet\to h(S_\bullet)$ preserves final objects, it suffices to show that for any pair of simplicial sets $S_\bullet$ and $T_\bullet$, the canonical map
\[u:h(S_\bullet\times T_\bullet)\to h(S_\bullet)\times h(T_\bullet)\]
is an isomorphism of categories. In other words, we want to show that for any category $\mathcal{C}$, composition with $u$ induces a bijection
\[\Hom_{\mathbf{Cat}}(h(S_\bullet)\times h(T_\bullet),\mathcal{C})\to\Hom_{\mathbf{Cat}}(h(S_\bullet\times T_\bullet),\mathcal{C}).\]
Unwinding the definitions and using the adjunction of $h$ and $N_\bullet$:
\begin{gather*}
\Hom_{\mathbf{Cat}}(h(S_\bullet)\times h(T_\bullet),\mathcal{C})\cong\Hom_{\mathbf{Cat}}(h(S_\bullet),\Fun(h(T_\bullet),\mathcal{C}))\cong \Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(S_\bullet,N_\bullet(\Fun(h(T_\bullet),\mathcal{C}))),\\
\Hom_{\mathbf{Cat}}(h(S_\bullet\times T_\bullet),\mathcal{C})\cong\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(S_\bullet\times T_\bullet,N_\bullet(\mathcal{C}))\cong\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(S_\bullet,\Fun(T_\bullet,N_\bullet(\mathcal{C})))
\end{gather*}
we see that this map is in fact given by
\begin{align*}
\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(S_\bullet,N_\bullet(\Fun(h(T_\bullet),\mathcal{C})))\stackrel{\rho_{T_\bullet}\circ}{\to}\Hom_{\mathbf{Set}_\Delta}(S_\bullet,\Fun(T_\bullet,N_\bullet(\mathcal{C}))),
\end{align*}
where $\rho_{T_\bullet}$ is the isomorphism appearing in the statement of \cref{simplicial set Fun to nerve isomorphism}.
\end{proof}
We will be primarily interested in the special case where the target simplicial set $T_\bullet$ is an $\infty$-category. In this case, we have the following result:
\begin{theorem}\label{simplicial set Fun of inf-cat is inf-cat}
Let $S_\bullet$ be a simplicial set and let $\mathcal{D}$ be an $\infty$-category. Then the simplicial set $\Fun(S_\bullet,\mathcal{D})$ is an $\infty$-category.
\end{theorem}
If $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ are $\infty$-categories, by \cref{simplicial set Fun of inf-cat is inf-cat} simplicial set $\Fun(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})$ is an $\infty$-category, which is called the $\infty$-category of functors from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{D}$. By definition, the objects of the $\infty$-category $\Fun(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})$ can be identified with functors from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{D}$ (that is, with maps of simplicial sets from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{D}$). We say the morphisms of $\Fun(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})$ are natural tranformations. That is, if $F,G:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$ are objects of $\Fun(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})$, we define a natural transformation from $F$ to $G$ to be a map of simplicial sets $u:\Delta^1\times\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$ satisfying $u|_{\{0\}\times\mathcal{C}}=F$ and $u|_{\{1\}\times\mathcal{C}}=G$.\par
Let us abuse notation by identifying each ordinary category $\mathcal{E}$ with the $\infty$-category $N_\bullet(\mathcal{E})$. In this case, \cref{simplicial set Fun to nerve isomorphism} implies that when $\mathcal{C}$ is an $\infty$-category and $\mathcal{D}$ is an ordinary category, then we have a canonical isomorphism $\Fun(C,D)\cong\Fun(h(\mathcal{C}),\mathcal{D})$. In particular, the functor $\infty$-category $\Fun(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})$ is an ordinary category.
